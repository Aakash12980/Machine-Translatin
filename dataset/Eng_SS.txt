They need others’ help
To help the helpless people is our duty
Let students tell about helpless and handicaps of their neighbouring area
By this they will develop an exploring habit
Describe different kinds of disabilities which students could not tell
If there are helpless and handicapped in the classroom we should not say or perform other activities that hurt them

Thats why we have to keep care of long benches and desks of the school
Chautaro is also our common property 
People rest there
People will not have place to rest in collapsed chautaro
Thats why we should all take care of existing chautaro
Bus and phone are also things that are required by all 
This is our common property
Tele-phone makes us easier to talk to people from far and near
Thats why we should not break, cut phone wires
We should take care of it

There is only one tap in the village of Tuisi
Villagers fetch water from the tap turn-wise
Tuisi was taking bath along with his mother there
In the meantime, Lumana came to fetch water
Lumana was in a hurry for some work
Thats why Tuisi gave Lumana turn first
After Lumana finished taking water he took bath
Inspire students to make a queue
Teach students to enter the class-room in line and go out turn-wise
Instruct students to stand in the queue in tap, telephone, bus, post office, temples etc

Chibha's village is in the mountain
Mountain is in high-land
There is also low lands in the mountain
The low land is called Byasi 
The objective of this lesson is to give students information about the different places, where they live in

Our village and town
This is the picture of village
There is a forest close around
The forest is densed as there are many trees in the forest 
There is a lake too in the middle of the village
Everyone has protected the forest
Villagers get grass, fire-wood and timber from the forest
There is a river near the village
River is big
Lumanti lives in a town
There is a pond a bit far from the town
The pond is small
The pond was made by the people of the town
There is a forest away from the town
The forest is very sparse 
The forest was densed before 
The people of the town cut many trees down to make their houses
So, now the forest has been sparsed 
This lesson tries to give the concept of natural resources like river, forest, pond, lake, mountain to the students
That's why, make students familiar with natural resources by taking them to visit around their community
Near the village, there is a river
Near the town, there is a pond

Far from the town, there is a forest
Kipa wrote about the resources around her village in this way

Look
Jujukaji looked far off
He saw his village at a distance
Jujukaji became happy
Aha! How beautiful it looks! Jujukaji said
When he looked from a height he saw his house like this
Since, the objective of the lesson is to give the concept to the students that from a low-land things of close-distance and from the high-altitude things of far-distance can be seen, make students visit different places and let them express about the places they have seen
Likewise make them draw the picture of the place they are living
You too walk uphill
Look around

Share your experiences with your friends in the classroom
Draw a map of the place you saw from the hill top and show it to your teacher
From a low-land, things of close-distance are seen
From high up, you can see things far off
