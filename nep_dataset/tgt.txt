a form of asbestos once used to make kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago researchers reported.
the asbestos fiber crocidolite is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later researchers said.
lorillard inc. the unit of new york-based loews corp. that makes kent cigarettes stopped using crocidolite in its micronite cigarette filters in 1956.
although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago the latest results appear in today 's new england journal of medicine a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem.
a lorillard spokewoman said  this is an old story.
we 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties.
there is no asbestos in our products now.
neither lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the kent cigarettes.
we have no useful information on whether users are at risk  said james a. talcott of boston 's dana-farber cancer institute.
dr. talcott led a team of researchers from the national cancer institute and the medical schools of harvard university and boston university.
the lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in  very modest amounts  in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956.
from 1953 to 1955 9.8 billion kent cigarettes with the filters were sold the company said.
among 33 men who worked closely with the substance 28 have died more than three times the expected number.
four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases including three with recently diagnosed cancer.
the total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected the researchers said.
the morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos-related diseases  said dr. talcott.
the percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the west groton mass. paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in western industrialized countries he said.
the plant which is owned by hollingsworth & vose co. was under contract with lorillard to make the cigarette filters.
the finding probably will support those who argue that the u.s. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos chrysotile found in most schools and other buildings dr. talcott said.
the u.s. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that *t*-1 are classified as amphobiles according to brooke t. mossman a professor of pathlogy at the university of vermont college of medicine.
more common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body dr. mossman explained.
in july the environmental protection agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos.
by 1997 almost all remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed.
about 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s.
areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used.
workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters.
workers described  clouds of blue dust  that hung over parts of the factory even though exhaust fans ventilated the area.
there 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases  said darrell phillips vice president of human resources for hollingsworth & vose.
but you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago.
it has no bearing on our work force today.
yields on money-market mutual funds continued to slide amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates.
the average seven-day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by ibc 's money fund report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45  from 8.47  for the week ended tuesday.
compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year.
average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days the longest since early august according to donoghue 's.
longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period.
shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner.
the average maturity for funds open only to institutions considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely reached a high point for the year 33 days.
nevertheless said brenda malizia negus editor of money fund report yields  may blip up again before they blip down  because of recent rises in short-term interest rates.
the yield on six-month treasury bills sold at monday 's auction for example rose to 8.04  from 7.90.
despite recent declines in yields investors continue to pour cash into money funds.
assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $ 1.5 billion during the latest week to $ 352.7 billion.
typically money-fund yields beat comparable short-term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates.
the top money funds are currently yielding well over 9.
dreyfus world-wide dollar the top-yielding fund had a seven-day compound yield of 9.37  during the latest week down from 9.45  a week earlier.
it invests heavily in dollar-denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees which boosts its yield.
the average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12  down from 8.14.
the 30-day simple yield fell to an average 8.19  from 8.22  ; the 30-day compound yield slid to an average 8.53  from 8.56.

it employs 2,700 people and has annual revenue of about $ 370 million.
the federal government suspended sales of u.s. savings bonds because congress has n't lifted the ceiling on government debt.
until congress acts the government has n't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind the treasury said.
the government 's borrowing authority dropped at midnight tuesday to $ 2.80 trillion from $ 2.87 trillion.
legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes.
the house has voted to raise the ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion but the senate is n't expected to act until next week at the earliest.
the treasury said the u.s. will default on nov. 9 if congress does n't act by then.

when it 's time for their biannual powwow the nation 's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like boca raton and hot springs.
not this year.
the national association of manufacturers settled on the hoosier capital of indianapolis for its fall board meeting.
and the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners.
the idea of course : to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the rust belt is n't so rusty after all that it 's a good place for a company to expand.
on the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like du pont and maytag along with lesser knowns like trojan steel and the valley queen cheese factory.
for starters the executives joined mayor william h. hudnut iii for an evening of the indianapolis symphony orchestra and a guest pianist-comedian victor borge.
champagne and dessert followed.
the next morning with a police escort busloads of executives and their wives raced to the indianapolis motor speedway unimpeded by traffic or red lights.
the governor could n't make it so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests.
a buffet breakfast was held in the museum where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors.
then in the guests ' honor the speedway hauled out four drivers crews and even the official indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10-lap exhibition race.
after the race fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers.
no dummies the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor 's name or two.
back downtown the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again.
this time it was for dinner and dancing a block away.
under the stars and moons of the renovated indiana roof ballroom nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them indiana duckling mousseline lobster consomme veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce.
knowing a tasty and free meal when they eat one the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation.
more than a few ceos say the red-carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings.
but for now they 're looking forward to their winter meeting boca in february.
south korea registered a trade deficit of $ 101 million in october reflecting the country 's economic sluggishness according to government figures released wednesday.
preliminary tallies by the trade and industry ministry showed another trade deficit in october the fifth monthly setback this year casting a cloud on south korea 's export-oriented economy.
exports in october stood at $ 5.29 billion a mere 0.7  increase from a year earlier while imports increased sharply to $ 5.39 billion up 20  from last october.
south korea 's economic boom which began in 1986 stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes trade conflicts and sluggish exports.
government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion.
despite the gloomy forecast south korea has recorded a trade surplus of $ 71 million so far this year.
from january to october the nation 's accumulated exports increased 4  from the same period last year to $ 50.45 billion.
imports were at $ 50.38 billion up 19.
newsweek trying to keep pace with rival time magazine announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers.
the new ad plan from newsweek a unit of the washington post co. is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years.
plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between newsweek time warner inc. 's time magazine and mortimer b. zuckerman 's u.s. news & world report.
alan spoon recently named newsweek president said newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5  in january.
a full four-color page in newsweek will cost $ 100,980.
in mid-october time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates ; with a lower circulation base time 's ad rate will be effectively 7.5  higher per subscriber ; a full page in time costs about $ 120,000.
u.s. news has yet to announce its 1990 ad rates.
newsweek said it will introduce the circulation credit plan which awards space credits to advertisers on  renewal advertising.
the magazine will reward with  page bonuses  advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending as long as they spent $ 325,000 in 1989 and $ 340,000 in 1990.
mr. spoon said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989 ; newsweek 's ad pages totaled 1,620 a drop of 3.2  from last year according to publishers information bureau.
what matters is what advertisers are paying per page and in that department we are doing fine this fall  said mr. spoon.
both newsweek and u.s. news have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers such as telephones or watches.
however none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently.
according to audit bureau of circulations time the largest newsweekly had average circulation of 4,393,237 a decrease of 7.3.
newsweek 's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453 flat from the same period last year.
u.s. news ' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328 down 2.6.
new england electric system bowed out of the bidding for public service co. of new hampshire saying that the risks were too high and the potential payoff too far in the future to justify a higher offer.
the move leaves united illuminating co. and northeast utilities as the remaining outside bidders for ps of new hampshire which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company *t*-2.
new england electric based in westborough mass. had offered $ 2 billion to acquire ps of new hampshire well below the $ 2.29 billion value united illuminating places on its bid and the $ 2.25 billion northeast says its bid is worth.
united illuminating is based in new haven conn. and northeast is based in hartford conn.
ps of new hampshire manchester n.h. values its internal reorganization plan at about $ 2.2 billion.
john rowe president and chief executive officer of new england electric said the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to ps of new hampshire such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies did n't come true.
when we evaluated raising our bid the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years and the rewards seemed a long way out.
that got hard to take  he added.
mr. rowe also noted that political concerns also worried new england electric.
no matter who owns ps of new hampshire after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation he said.
that attracts attention  it was just another one of the risk factors  that led to the company 's decision to withdraw from the bidding he added.
wilbur ross jr. of rothschild inc. the financial adviser to the troubled company 's equity holders said 0 the withdrawal of new england electric might speed up the reorganization process.
the fact that new england proposed lower rate increases 4.8  over seven years against around 5.5  boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders complicated negotiations with state officials mr. ross asserted *t*-1.
now the field is less cluttered  he added.
separately the federal energy regulatory commission turned down for now a request by northeast seeking approval of its possible purchase of ps of new hampshire.
northeast said it would refile its request and still hopes for an expedited review by the ferc so that it could complete the purchase by next summer if its bid is the one approved by the bankruptcy court.
ps of new hampshire shares closed yesterday at $ 3.75 off 25 cents in new york stock exchange composite trading.
norman ricken 52 years old and former president and chief operating officer of toys  r  us inc. and frederick deane jr. 63 chairman of signet banking corp. were elected directors of this consumer electronics and appliances retailing chain.
they succeed daniel m. rexinger retired circuit city executive vice president and robert r. glauber u.s. treasury undersecretary on the 12-member board.
commonwealth edison co. was ordered to refund about $ 250 million to its current and former ratepayers for illegal rates collected for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant.
the refund was about $ 55 million more than previously ordered by the illinois commerce commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility.
state court judge richard curry ordered edison to make average refunds of about $ 45 to $ 50 each to edison customers who have received electric service since april 1986 including about two million customers who have moved during that period.
judge curry ordered the refunds to begin feb. 1 and said that he would n't entertain any appeals or other attempts to block his order by commonwealth edison.
the refund pool  may not be held hostage through another round of appeals  judge curry said.
commonwealth edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing judge curry 's order.
the exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual collections made until dec. 31 of this year.
commonwealth edison said the ruling could force it to slash its 1989 earnings by $ 1.55 a share.
for 1988 commonwealth edison reported earnings of $ 737.5 million or $ 3.01 a share.
a commonwealth edison spokesman said that tracking down the two million customers whose addresses have changed during the past 3 1/2 years would be  an administrative nightmare.
in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday commonwealth edison closed at $ 38.375 *u* down 12.5 cents.
the $ 2.5 billion byron 1 plant near rockford ill. was completed in 1985.
in a disputed 1985 ruling the commerce commission said commonwealth edison could raise its electricity rates by $ 49 million to pay for the plant.
but state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission 's rate increase and found the rates illegal.
the illinois supreme court ordered the commission to audit commonwealth edison 's construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses.
the utility has been collecting for the plant 's construction cost from its 3.1 million customers subject to a refund since 1986.
in august the commission ruled that between $ 190 million and $ 195 million of the plant 's construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded plus interest.
in his ruling judge curry added an additional $ 55 million to the commission 's calculations.
last month judge curry set the interest rate on the refund at 9.
commonwealth edison now faces an additional court-ordered refund on its summer/winter rate differential collections that the illinois appellate court has estimated at $ 140 million.
and consumer groups hope that judge curry 's byron 1 order may set a precedent for a second nuclear rate case involving commonwealth edison 's braidwood 2 plant.
commonwealth edison is seeking about $ 245 million in rate increases to pay for braidwood 2.
the commission is expected to rule on the braidwood 2 case by year end.
last year commonwealth edison had to refund $ 72.7 million for poor performance of its lasalle i nuclear plant.
japan 's domestic sales of cars trucks and buses in october rose 18  from a year earlier to 500,004 units a record for the month the japan automobile dealers ' association said.
the strong growth followed year-to-year increases of 21  in august and 12  in september.
the monthly sales have been setting records every month since march.
october sales compared with the previous month inched down 0.4.
sales of passenger cars grew 22  from a year earlier to 361,376 units.
sales of medium-sized cars which benefited from price reductions arising from introduction of the consumption tax more than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 in october 1988.
texas instruments japan ltd. a unit of texas instruments inc. said it opened a plant in south korea to manufacture control devices.
the new plant located in chinchon about 60 miles from seoul will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in south korea the company said.
the plant will produce control devices used in motor vehicles and household appliances.
the survival of spinoff cray computer corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity and longevity of its chairman and chief designer seymour cray.
not only is development of the new company 's initial machine tied directly to mr. cray so is its balance sheet.
documents filed with the securities and exchange commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that cray research inc. will withdraw the almost $ 100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if mr. cray leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped.
the documents also said that although the 64-year-old mr. cray has been working on the project for more than six years the cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype.
moreover there have been no orders for the cray-3 so far though the company says it is talking with several prospects.
while many of the risks were anticipated when minneapolis-based cray research first announced the spinoff in may *t*-1 the strings it attached to the financing had n't been made public until yesterday.
we did n't have much of a choice  cray computer 's chief financial officer gregory barnum said in an interview.
the theory is that seymour is the chief designer of the cray-3 and without him it could not be completed.
cray research did not want to fund a project that did not include seymour.
the documents also said that cray computer anticipates needing perhaps another $ 120 million in financing beginning next september.
but mr. barnum called that  a worst-case  scenario.
the filing on the details of the spinoff caused cray research stock to jump $ 2.875 yesterday to close at $ 38 in new york stock exchange composite trading.
analysts noted yesterday that cray research 's decision to link its $ 98.3 million promissory note to mr. cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company.
it has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor  said gary p. smaby of smaby group inc. minneapolis.
cray computer will be a concept stock  he said.
you either believe seymour can do it again or you do n't.
besides the designer 's age other risk factors for mr. cray 's new company include the cray-3 's tricky unproven chip technology.
the sec documents describe those chips which are made of gallium arsenide as being so fragile and minute they will require special robotic handling equipment.
in addition the cray-3 will contain 16 processors twice as many as the largest current supercomputer.
cray computer also will face intense competition not only from cray research which has about 60  of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the c-90 machine a direct competitor with the cray-3 in 1991.
the spinoff also will compete with international business machines corp. and japan 's big three hitachi ltd. nec corp. and fujitsu ltd.
the new company said it believes there are fewer than 100 potential customers for supercomputers priced between $ 15 million and $ 30 million presumably the cray-3 price range.
under terms of the spinoff cray research stockholders are to receive one cray computer share for every two cray research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks.
no price for the new shares has been set.
instead the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide.
cray computer has applied to trade on nasdaq.
analysts calculate cray computer 's initial book value at about $ 4.75 a share.
along with the note cray research is transferring about $ 53 million in assets primarily those related to the cray-3 development which has been a drain on cray research 's earnings.
pro-forma balance sheets clearly show why cray research favored the spinoff.
without the cray-3 research and development expenses the company would have been able to report a profit of $ 19.3 million for the first half of 1989 rather than the $ 5.9 million it posted.
on the other hand had it existed then cray computer would have incurred a $ 20.5 million loss.
mr. cray who could n't be reached for comment will work for the new colorado springs colo. company as an independent contractor the arrangement he had with cray research.
regarded as the father of the supercomputer mr. cray was paid $ 600,000 at cray research last year.
at cray computer he will be paid $ 240,000.
besides messrs. cray and barnum other senior management at the company includes neil davenport 47 president and chief executive officer ; joseph m. blanchard 37 vice president engineering ; malcolm a. hammerton 40 vice president software ; and douglas r. wheeland 45 vice president hardware.
all came from cray research.
cray computer which currently employs 241 people said it expects a work force of 450 by the end of 1990.
john r. stevens 49 years old was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer both new positions.
he will continue to report to donald pardus president and chief executive officer.
mr. stevens was executive vice president of this electric-utility holding company.
arthur a. hatch 59 was named executive vice president of the company.
he was previously president of the company 's eastern edison co. unit.
john d. carney 45 was named to succeed mr. hatch as president of eastern edison.
previously he was vice president of eastern edison.
robert p. tassinari 63 was named senior vice president of eastern utilities.
he was previously vice president.
the u.s. claiming some success in its trade diplomacy removed south korea taiwan and saudi arabia from a list of countries it is closely watching for allegedly failing to honor u.s. patents copyrights and other intellectual-property rights.
however five other countries china thailand india brazil and mexico will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review u.s. trade representative carla hills announced.
under the new u.s. trade law those countries could face accelerated unfair-trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they do n't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring.
mrs. hills said many of the 25 countries that she placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made  genuine progress  on this touchy issue.
she said there is  growing realization  around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms all trading nations and particularly the  creativity and inventiveness of an -lcb- offending -rcb- country 's own citizens.
u.s. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual-property rights could be hurting themselves by discouraging their own scientists and authors and by deterring u.s. high-technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there.
mrs. hills lauded south korea for creating an intellectual-property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates.
seoul also has instituted effective search-and-seizure procedures to aid these teams she said.
taiwan has improved its standing with the u.s. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films.
that measure could compel taipei 's growing number of small video-viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing their films.
saudi arabia for its part has vowed to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works mrs. hills said.
these three countries are n't completely off the hook though.
they will remain on a lower-priority list that includes 17 other countries.
those countries including japan italy canada greece and spain are still of some concern to the u.s. but are deemed to pose less-serious problems for american patent and copyright owners than those on the  priority  list.
gary hoffman a washington lawyer specializing in intellectual-property cases said the threat of u.s. retaliation combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest prompted the improvements made by south korea taiwan and saudi arabia.
what this tells us is that u.s. trade law is working  he said.
he said mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law.
mrs. hills said that the u.s. is still concerned about  disturbing developments in turkey and continuing slow progress in malaysia.
she did n't elaborate although earlier u.s. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in malaysia and disregard for u.s. pharmaceutical patents in turkey.
the 1988 trade act requires mrs. hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by april 30.
so far mrs. hills has n't deemed any cases bad enough to merit an accelerated investigation under the so-called special 301 provision of the act.
argentina said it will ask creditor banks to halve its foreign debt of $ 64 billion the third-highest in the developing world.
the declaration by economy minister nestor rapanelli is believed to be the first time such an action has been called for by an argentine official of such stature.
the latin american nation has paid very little on its debt since early last year.
argentina aspires to reach a reduction of 50  in the value of its external debt  mr. rapanelli said through his spokesman miguel alurralde.
mr. rapanelli met in august with u.s. assistant treasury secretary david mulford.
argentine negotiator carlos carballo was in washington and new york this week to meet with banks.
mr. rapanelli recently has said the government of president carlos menem who took office july 8 feels a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way the debt problem may be solved.
but he has not said before that the country wants half the debt forgiven.
during its centennial year the wall street journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of american business history.
three computers that changed the face of personal computing were launched in 1977.
that year the apple ii commodore pet and tandy trs-80 came to market.
the computers were crude by today 's standards.
apple ii owners for example had to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes.
but apple ii was a major advance from apple i which was built in a garage by stephen wozniak and steven jobs for hobbyists such as the homebrew computer club.
in addition the apple ii was an affordable $ 1,298.
crude as they were these early pcs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office.
big mainframe computers for business had been around for years.
but the new 1977 pcs unlike earlier built-from-kit types such as the altair sol and imsai had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories.
current pcs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than their 1977 counterparts.
there were many pioneer pc contributors.
william gates and paul allen in 1975 developed an early language-housekeeper system for pcs and gates became an industry billionaire six years after ibm adapted one of these versions in 1981.
alan f. shugart currently chairman of seagate technology led the team that developed the disk drives for pcs.
dennis hayes and dale heatherington two atlanta engineers were co-developers of the internal modems that allow pcs to share data via the telephone.
ibm the world leader in computers did n't offer its first pc until august 1981 as many other companies entered the market.
today pc shipments annually total some $ 38.3 billion world-wide.
f.h. faulding & co. an australian pharmaceuticals company said its moleculon inc. affiliate acquired kalipharma inc. for $ 23 million.
kalipharma is a new jersey-based pharmaceuticals concern that sells products under the purepac label.
faulding said it owns 33  of moleculon 's voting stock and has an agreement to acquire an additional 19.
that stake together with its convertible preferred stock holdings gives faulding the right to increase its interest to 70  of moleculon 's voting stock.
oil production from australia 's bass strait fields will be raised by 11,000 barrels a day to about 321,000 barrels with the launch of the whiting field the first of five small fields scheduled to be brought into production before the end of 1990.
esso australia ltd. a unit of new york-based exxon corp. and broken hill pty. operate the fields in a joint venture.
esso said the whiting field started production tuesday.
output will be gradually increased until it reaches about 11,000 barrels a day.
the field has reserves of 21 million barrels.
reserves for the five new fields total 50 million barrels.
the perch and dolphin fields are expected to start producing early next year and the seahorse and tarwhine fields later next year.
esso said the fields were developed after the australian government decided in 1987 to make the first 30 million barrels from new fields free of excise tax.
r.p. scherer corp. said it completed the $ 10.2 million sale of its southern optical subsidiary to a group led by the unit 's president thomas r. sloan and other managers.
following the acquisition of r.p. scherer by a buy-out group led by shearson lehman hutton earlier this year the maker of gelatin capsules decided to divest itself of certain of its non-encapsulating businesses.

the white house said president bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that are n't produced in  significant quantities  in the u.s. the virgin islands and other u.s. possessions.
the action came in response to a petition filed by timex inc. for changes in the u.s. generalized system of preferences for imports from developing nations.
previously watch imports were denied *-37 such duty-free treatment.
timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches covered by 58 different u.s. tariff classifications.
the white house said mr. bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories but turned down such treatment for other types of watches  because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the u.s. and the virgin islands.
timex is a major u.s. producer and seller of watches including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the philippines and other developing nations covered by the u.s. tariff preferences.
u.s. trade officials said the philippines and thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action.
imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $ 37.3 million in 1988 a relatively small share of the $ 1.5 billion in u.s. watch imports that year according to an aide to u.s. trade representative carla hills.
magna international inc. 's chief financial officer james mcalpine resigned and its chairman frank stronach is stepping in to help turn the automotive-parts manufacturer around the company said.
mr. stronach will direct an effort to reduce overhead and curb capital spending  until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained  magna said.
stephen akerfeldt currently vice president finance will succeed mr. mcalpine.
an ambitious expansion has left magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn.
the company has reported declines in operating profit in each of the past three years despite steady sales growth.
magna recently cut its quarterly dividend in half and the company 's class a shares are wallowing far below their 52-week high of 16.125 canadian dollars us$ 13.73.
on the toronto stock exchange yesterday magna shares closed up 37.5 canadian cents to c$ 9.625.
mr. stronach founder and controlling shareholder of magna resigned as chief executive officer last year to seek unsuccessfully a seat in canada 's parliament.
analysts said mr. stronach wants to resume a more influential role in running the company.
they expect him to cut costs throughout the organization.
the company said 0 mr. stronach will personally direct the restructuring assisted by manfred gingl president and chief executive.
neither they nor mr. mcalpine could be reached for comment.
magna said mr. mcalpine resigned to pursue a consulting career with magna as one of his clients.

japanese investors nearly single-handedly bought up two new mortgage securities-based mutual funds totaling $ 701 million the u.s. federal national mortgage association said.
the purchases show the strong interest of japanese investors in u.s. mortgage-based instruments fannie mae 's chairman david o. maxwell said at a news conference.
he said more than 90  of the funds were placed with japanese institutional investors.
the rest went to investors from france and hong kong.
earlier this year japanese investors snapped up a similar $ 570 million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund.
that fund was put together by blackstone group a new york investment bank.
the latest two funds were assembled jointly by goldman sachs & co. of the u.s. and japan 's daiwa securities co.
the new seven-year funds one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the london interbank offered rate offer two key advantages to japanese investors.
first they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates.
second they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments reducing the administrative burden on investors.
by addressing those problems mr. maxwell said the new funds have become  extremely attractive to japanese and other investors outside the u.s.
such devices have boosted japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than 1  of the $ 900 billion in such instruments outstanding and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate.
they also have become large purchasers of fannie mae 's corporate debt buying $ 2.4 billion in fannie mae bonds during the first nine months of the year or almost a tenth of the total amount issued.
james l. pate 54-year-old executive vice president was named a director of this oil concern expanding the board to 14 members.
ltv corp. said a federal bankruptcy court judge agreed to extend until march 8 1990 the period in which the steel aerospace and energy products company has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan.

italian chemical giant montedison s.p.a. through its montedison acquisition n.v. indirect unit began its $ 37-a-share tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of erbamont n.v. a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated in the netherlands.
the offer advertised in today 's editions of the wall street journal is scheduled to expire at the end of november.
montedison currently owns about 72  of erbamont 's common shares outstanding.
the offer is being launched pursuant to a previously announced agreement between the companies.
japan 's reserves of gold convertible foreign currencies and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $ 1.82 billion in october to $ 84.29 billion the finance ministry said.
the total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline.
the protracted downturn reflects the intensity of bank of japan yen-support intervention since june when the u.s. currency temporarily surged above the 150.00 yen level.
the announcement follows a sharper $ 2.2 billion decline in the country 's foreign reserves in september to $ 86.12 billion.
pick a country any country.
it 's the latest investment craze sweeping wall street : a rash of new closed-end country funds those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country.
no fewer than 24 country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year triple the level of all of 1988 according to charles e. simon & co. a washington-based research firm.
the turf recently has ranged from chile to austria to portugal.
next week the philippine fund 's launch will be capped by a visit by philippine president corazon aquino the first time a head of state has kicked off an issue at the big board here.
the next province ? anything 's possible how about the new guinea fund ?
quips george foot a managing partner at newgate management associates of northampton mass.
the recent explosion of country funds mirrors the  closed-end fund mania  of the 1920s mr. foot says when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular.
they fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash.
unlike traditional open-end mutual funds most of these one-country portfolios are the  closed-end  type issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly.
the surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in new york or london.
these funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets.
people are looking *-1 to stake their claims  now before the number of available nations runs out says michael porter an analyst at smith barney harris upham & co. new york.
behind all the hoopla is some heavy-duty competition.
as individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell.
and the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it.
financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities.
and many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets such as the u.s. and japan.
country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies.
but it does n't take much to get burned.
political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds.
another concern : the funds ' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market.
when the stock market dropped nearly 7  oct. 13 for instance the mexico fund plunged about 18  and the spain fund fell 16.
and most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the 1987 crash.
what 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios.
after trading at an average discount of more than 20  in late 1987 and part of last year country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6.
the reason : share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold.
it 's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors such as south korea some specialists say.
but some european funds recently have skyrocketed ; spain fund has surged to a startling 120  premium.
it has been targeted by japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to 1992 's european economic integration.
and several new funds that are n't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums.
i 'm very alarmed to see these rich valuations  says smith barney 's mr. porter.
the newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds mr. porter suggests.
unlike many u.s. investors those in asia or europe seeking foreign-stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds.
there may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here  mr. porter says.
nonetheless plenty of u.s. analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds.
they argue that u.s. investors often can buy american depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds ; these so-called adrs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the u.s.
that way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium.
for people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds newgate 's mr. foot says :  the only advice i have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly.
the u.s. and soviet union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by moscow of $ 188 million in pre-communist russian debts owed to the u.s. government the state department said.
if the debts are repaid it could clear the way for soviet bonds to be sold in the u.s.
however after two meetings with the soviets a state department spokesman said that it 's  too early to say  whether that will happen.
coincident with the talks the state department said it has permitted a soviet bank to open a new york branch.
the branch of the bank for foreign economic affairs was approved last spring and opened in july.
but a soviet bank here would be crippled unless moscow found a way to settle the $ 188 million debt which was lent to the country 's short-lived democratic kerensky government before the communists seized power in 1917.
under a 1934 law the johnson debt default act as amended it 's illegal for americans to extend credit to countries in default to the u.s. government unless they are members of the world bank and international monetary fund.
the u.s.s.r. belongs to neither organization.
moscow has settled pre-1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value.
the state department stressed the pre-1933 debts as the key to satisfying the johnson act.
but the soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the u.s. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the world war ii lend-lease program.
in another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in september.
meanwhile the national association of purchasing management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in october for the sixth consecutive month.
its index inched up to 47.6  in october from 46  in september.
any reading below 50  suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining.
the purchasing managers however also said that orders turned up in october after four months of decline.
factories booked $ 236.74 billion in orders in september nearly the same as the $ 236.79 billion in august the commerce department said.
if not for a 59.6  surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors factory orders would have fallen 2.1.
in a separate report the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ 415.6 billion not significantly different from the $ 415.8 billion reported for august.
private construction spending was down but government building activity was up.
the figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns but were n't adjusted for inflation.
kenneth mayland economist for society corp. a cleveland bank said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off.
at the same time the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry.
what sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack ? he asked.
i draw a blank.
by most measures the nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly if at all.
factory payrolls fell in september.
so did the federal reserve board 's industrial-production index.
yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession.
they cite a lack of  imbalances  that provide early warning signals of a downturn.
inventories are closely watched for such clues for instance.
economists say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession.
but yesterday 's factory orders report had good news on that front : it said factory inventories fell 0.1  in september the first decline since february 1987.
this conforms to the  soft landing ' scenario  said elliott platt an economist at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp.
i do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive.
a soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession.
the department said orders for nondurable goods those intended to last fewer than three years fell 0.3  in september to $ 109.73 billion after climbing 0.9  the month before.
orders for durable goods were up 0.2  to $ 127.03 billion after rising 3.9  the month before.
the department previously estimated that durable-goods orders fell 0.1  in september.
factory shipments fell 1.6  to $ 234.4 billion after rising 5.4  in august.
shipments have been relatively level since january the commerce department noted.
manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5  in september to $ 497.34 billion *u* helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector.
excluding these orders backlogs declined 0.3.
in its construction spending report the commerce department said residential construction which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending was off 0.9  in september to an annual rate of $ 191.9 billion.
david berson economist for the mortgage bankers association predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes but probably not until early next year.
spending on private nonresidential construction was off 2.6  to an annual rate of $ 99.1 billion with no sector showing strength.
government construction spending rose 4.3  to $ 88 billion.
after adjusting for inflation the commerce department said construction spending did n't change in september.
for the first nine months of the year total construction spending ran about 2  above last year 's level.
the government 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by mcgraw-hill inc. 's f.w. dodge group.
dodge reported an 8  increase in construction contracts awarded in september.
the goverment counts money as it is spent ; dodge counts contracts when they are awarded.
the government includes money spent on residential renovation ; dodge does n't.
although the purchasing managers ' index continues to indicate a slowing economy it is n't signaling an imminent recession said robert bretz chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at pitney bowes inc. stamford conn.
he said the index would have to be in the low 40  range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession.
the report offered new evidence that the nation 's export growth though still continuing may be slowing.
only 19  of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in october down from 27  in september.
and 8  said export orders were down last month compared with 6  the month before.
the purhasing managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control.
for the fifth consecutive month purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell.
the decline was even steeper than in september.
they also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in october than they had for each of the five previous months.
economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating.
when demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen prices tend to rise.
the purchasing managers ' report is based on data provided by more than 250 purchasing executives.
each of the survey 's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening.
for the first time the october survey polled members on imports.
it found that of the 73  who import 10  said they imported more in october and 12  said they imported less than the previous month.
while acknowledging one month 's figures do n't prove a trend mr. bretz said  it does lead you to suspect imports are going down or at least not increasing that much.
items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen but they included one newcomer : milk and milk powder.
it 's an odd thing to put on the list  mr. bretz noted.
he said that for the second month in a row food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk.
they blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high u.s. exports of dry milk coupled with very low import quotas.

judging from the americana in haruki murakami 's  a wild sheep chase  kodansha 320 pages $ 18.95 baby boomers on both sides of the pacific have a lot in common.

this is japan ?
for an american reader part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that japan is n't the buttoned-down society of contemporary american lore.
it 's also refreshing to read a japanese author who clearly does n't belong to the self-aggrandizing  we-japanese  school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique japanese unfathomable by outsiders.
if  a wild sheep chase  carries an implicit message for international relations it 's that the japanese are more like us than most of us think.
that 's not to say that the nutty plot of  a wild sheep chase  is rooted in reality.
it 's imaginative and often funny.
a disaffected hard-drinking nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister erudite mobster with a stanford degree.
he has in tow his prescient girlfriend whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly.
along the way he meets a solicitous christian chauffeur who offers the hero god 's phone number ; and the sheep man a sweet roughhewn figure who wears what else a sheepskin.
the 40-year-old mr. murakami is a publishing sensation in japan.

but he is just one of several youthful writers tokyo 's brat pack who are dominating the best-seller charts in japan.
their books are written in idiomatic contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of americana.
in robert whiting 's  you gotta have wa  macmillan 339 pages $ 17.95 the beatles give way to baseball in the nipponese version we would be hard put to call a  game.

wa  is japanese for  team spirit  and japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it.
a player 's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average.
polls once named tokyo giants star tatsunori hara a  humble uncomplaining obedient soul  as the male symbol of japan.
but other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat it 's unrecognizable : fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted even welcomed since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives players for the tokyo giants for example must always wear ties when on the road.
you gotta have wa  is the often amusing chronicle of how american ballplayers rationed to two per team fare in japan.
despite the enormous sums of money they 're paid to stand up at a japanese plate a good number decide it 's not worth it and run for home.
funny business  soho 228 pages $ 17.95 by gary katzenstein is anything but.
it 's the petulant complaint of an impudent american whom sony hosted for a year while he was on a luce fellowship in tokyo to the regret of both parties.
in sometimes amusing more often supercilious even vicious passages mr. katzenstein describes how sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers ' lives at the regimented office where employees are assigned lunch partners and at  home  in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker.
some of his observations about japanese management style are on the mark.
it 's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager and that sony was chary of letting a young short-term american employee take on any responsibility.
all of this must have been enormously frustrating to mr. katzenstein who *t*-59 went to sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another walkman.
but sony ultimately took a lesson from the american management books and fired mr. katzenstein after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable akio morita founder of sony.
it 's a shame their meeting never took place.
mr. katzenstein certainly would have learned something and it 's even possible mr. morita would have too.

a marketing study indicates that hong kong consumers are the most materialistic in the 14 major markets where the survey was carried out.
the study by the backer spielvogel bates ad agency also found that the colony 's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets which include the u.s. and japan.
the survey found that nearly half of hong kong consumers espouse what it identified as materialistic values compared with about one-third in japan and the u.s.
more than three in five said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time compared with less than one in two u.s. consumers and one in four in japan.

as an actor charles lane is n't the inheritor of charlie chaplin 's spirit.
steve martin has already laid his claim to that.
but it is mr. lane as movie director producer and writer who has been obsessed with refitting chaplin 's little tramp in a contemporary way.
in 1976 as a film student at the purchase campus of the state university of new york mr. lane shot  a place in time  a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist a man of the streets.
now 13 years later mr. lane has revived his artist in a full-length movie called  sidewalk stories  a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp.
of course if the film contained dialogue mr. lane 's artist would be called a homeless person.
so would the little tramp for that matter.
i say  contained dialogue  because  sidewalk stories  is n't really silent at all.
composer marc marder a college friend of mr. lane 's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles has prepared an exciting eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles or even words would.
much of mr. lane 's film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets though probably no more romanticized than mr. chaplin 's notion of the tramp as the good-hearted free spirit.
filmed in lovely black and white by bill dill the new york streets of  sidewalk stories  seem benign.
on wall street men and women walk with great purpose noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs.
the artist hangs out in greenwich village on a strip of sixth avenue populated by jugglers magicians and other good-natured hustlers.
this clearly is not real life : no crack dealers no dead-eyed men selling four-year-old copies of cosmopolitan no one curled up in a cardboard box.
the artist has his routine.
he spends his days sketching passers-by or trying to.
at night he returns to the condemned building he calls home.
his life including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist seems carefree.
he is his own man.
then just as the tramp is given a blind girl to cure in  city lights  the artist is put in charge of returning a two-year-old waif nicole alysia whose father has been murdered by thugs to her mother.
this cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse.
she gives the artist a sense of purpose but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life.
the beds at the bowery mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night.
to further load the stakes mr. lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the artist with a young woman who owns her own children 's shop and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building.
this story line might resonate more strongly if mr. lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it.
mr. lane 's final purpose is n't to glamorize the artist 's vagabond existence.
he has a point he wants to make and he makes it with a great deal of force.
the movie ends with sound the sound of street people talking and there is n't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough beaten voices.
the french film maker claude chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his  story of women.
he has made a harsh brilliant picture one that 's captivating about a character who viewed from the most sympathetic angle would seem disagreeable.
yet this woman marie-louise giraud carries historical significance both as one of the last women to be executed in france and as a symbol of the vichy government 's hypocrisy.
while vichy collaborated with the germans during world war ii in the deaths of thousands of resistance fighters and jews its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor.
marie-louise a small-time abortionist was their woman.
she became an abortionist accidentally and continued because it enabled her to buy jam cocoa and other war-rationed goodies.
she was untrained and in one botched job killed a client.
her remorse was shallow and brief.
although she was kind and playful to her children she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband ; she openly brought her lover into their home.
as presented by mr. chabrol and played with thin-lipped intensity by isabelle huppert marie-louise called marie latour in the film was not a nice person.
but she did n't deserve to have her head chopped off.
there is very little to recommend  old gringo  a confused rendering of the carlos fuentes novel of the mexican revolution.
most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory.
i mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot and this one has gregory peck in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die.
video tip : before seeing  sidewalk stories  take a look at  city lights  chaplin 's tramp at his finest.
boeing co. said it is discussing plans with three of its regular japanese suppliers * to possibly help build a larger version of its popular 767 twin-jet.
the discussions are still in preliminary stages and the specific details have n't been worked out between the seattle aerospace company and kawasaki heavy industries ltd. mitsubishi heavy industries ltd. and fuji heavy industries ltd.
the three japanese companies build the body sections of the 767 accounting for a combined 15  of the aircraft.
japanese press reports have speculated that the japanese contribution could rise to between 20  and 25  under the new program.
if boeing goes ahead with the larger 767 the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s.
this is the year the negative ad for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns became the main event.
the irony is that the attack commercial after getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign has come of age in an off-off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country.
but in the three leading political contests of 1989 the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility raising fears that this kind of mudslinging empty of significant issues is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content.
now  says joseph napolitan a pioneer in political television  the idea is to attack first last and always.
a trend that started with the first stirrings of politics accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in 1988 has reached an entirely new stage.
to get people 's attention these days  says douglas bailey a political consultant  your tv ad needs to be bold and entertaining and more often than not that means confrontational.
and unlike a few years ago you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is truthful.
in 1989 as often as not the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves.
take a look then at the main attack commercials that set the tone for tuesday 's elections in new york city new jersey and virginia : new york city : the screen fills with a small tight facial shot of david dinkins democratic candidate for mayor of new york city.
david dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years  says a disembodied male voice.
and then this television commercial paid for by republican rudolph giuliani 's campaign and produced by roger ailes the master of negative tv ads really gets down to business.
mr. dinkins the ad charges also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper  through a phony organization with no members no receipts and no office.
david dinkins  says the kicker  why does he always wait until he 's caught ?
nasty innuendoes  says john siegal mr. dinkins 's issues director  designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist.
stung by the giuliani ads mr. dinkins 's tv consultants robert shrum and david doak finally unleashed a negative ad of their own.
the screen shows two distorted unrecognizable photos presumably of two politicians.
compare two candidates for mayor  says the announcer.
one says he 's for banning cop-killer bullets.
the other has opposed a ban on cop-killer bullets.
one claims he 's pro-choice.
the other has opposed a woman 's right to choose.
funny thing  says the kicker  both these candidates are named rudolph giuliani.
who 's telling the truth ?
everybody and nobody.
it 's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate.
mr. dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years but he insists he voluntarily admitted the  oversight  when he was being considered for a city job.
he was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems but he insists he made no secret of it.
the city 's campaign finance board has refused to pay mr. dinkins $ 95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete.
the campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors.
and says mr. dinkins he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping.
but say mr. dinkins 's managers he did have an office and his organization did have members.
mr. giuliani 's campaign chairman peter powers says the dinkins ad is  deceptive.
the other side he argues  knows giuliani has always been pro-choice even though he has personal reservations.
they know he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation.
virginia : democratic lt. gov. douglas wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with republican marshall coleman with an abortion commercial produced by frank greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force.
against a shot of monticello superimposed on an american flag an announcer talks about the  strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty  that virginians have nurtured for generations.
then just as an image of the statue of thomas jefferson dissolves from the screen the announcer continues :  on the issue of abortion marshall coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians.
that commercial which said mr. coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion  even in cases of rape and incest  a charge mr. coleman denies changed the dynamics of the campaign transforming it at least in part into a referendum on abortion.
the ad prompted mr. coleman the former virginia attorney general to launch a series of advertisements created by bob goodman and designed to shake mr. wilder 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad.
the coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal.
a voice says  c'mon now do n't you have boyfriends ?
then an announcer interjects :  it was douglas wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists.
so the next time mr. wilder talks about the rights of women ask him about this law he tried to pass.
mr. wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago but he did so at the request of a constituent a common legislative technique used by lawmakers.
the legislation itself noted that it was introduced  by request  and in 1983 mr. wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation.
people have grown tired of these ads and coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner  says mark rozell a political scientist at mary washington college.
wilder has managed to get across the idea that coleman will say anything to get elected governor and more important has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on coleman.
mr. coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning but the truce lasted only hours.
by tuesday night television stations were carrying new ads featuring mr. coleman himself raising questions about mr. wilder 's sensitivity to rape victims.
new jersey : the attacks began when democratic rep. james florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of pinocchio and a photograph of mr. florio 's rival republican rep. jim courter.
remember pinocchio ?  says a female voice.
consider jim courter.
and then this commercial produced by bob squier gets down to its own mean and dirty business.
pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus and the female voice purrs  that hazardous waste on his -lcb- mr. courter 's -rcb- property the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud.
and the nose on mr. courter 's face grows.
the only fraud involved cry mr. courter 's partisans is the florio commercial itself and so the courter campaign has responded with its own pinocchio commercial produced by mr. ailes.
in this one the screen fills with photographs of both candidates.
who 's really lying ?  asks a female voice.
florio 's lying  the voice goes on because  the barrel on courter 's land  contained heating oil was cleaned up and caused no pollution.
mr. courter 's long nose shrinks while mr. florio 's grows.
who 's telling the truth ?
stephen salmore a political scientist at new jersey 's eagleton institute says it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate.
barrels were dumped on the courter property a complaint was made but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment.
even so according to mr. salmore the ad was  devastating  because it raised questions about mr. courter 's credibility.
but it 's building on a long tradition.
in 1966 on route to a re-election rout of democrat frank o'connor gop gov. nelson rockefeller of new york appeared in person saying  if you want to keep the crime rates high o'connor is your man.

japanese investment in southeast asia is propelling the region toward economic integration.
interviews with analysts and business people in the u.s. suggest that japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that southeast asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades.
but japan 's power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions.
the flow of japanese funds has set in motion  a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great japanese investment machine  says robert hormats vice chairman of goldman sachs international corp.
in the past five years japanese companies have tripled their commitments in asia to $ 5.57 billion.
in thailand for example the government 's board of investment approved $ 705.6 million of japanese investment in 1988 10 times the u.s. investment figure for the year.
japan 's commitment in southeast asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade.
asia 's other cash-rich countries are following japan 's lead and pumping capital into the region.
in taiwan and south korea rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production.
these nations known as asia 's  little tigers  also are contributing to southeast asia 's integration but their influence will remain subordinate to japan 's.
for recipient countries such as thailand and malaysia the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth.
but asian nations ' harsh memories of their military domination by japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under japanese economic hegemony now.
because of budget constraints in washington the u.s. encourages japan to share economic burdens in the region.
but it resists yielding political ground.
in the coming decade analysts say u.s.-japanese relations will be tested as tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic behemoth.
japan 's swelling investment in southeast asia is part of its economic evolution.
in the past decade japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export.
in the 1990s spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world.
to capture the investment southeast asian nations will move to accommodate japanese business.
these nations ' internal decisions  will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid donor largest private investor and largest lender  says richard drobnick director of the international business and research program at the university of southern california 's graduate school of business.
japanese money will help turn southeast asia into a more cohesive economic region.
but analysts say asian cooperation is n't likely to parallel the european common market approach.
rather japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors says kent calder a specialist in east asian economies at the woodrow wilson school for public and internatonal affairs at princeton university.
in electronics for example a japanese company might make television picture tubes in japan assemble the sets in malaysia and export them to indonesia.
the effect will be to pull asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone  says goldman sachs 's mr. hormats.
countries in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties.
the economic and foreign ministers of 12 asian and pacific nations will meet in australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications.
participants will include the u.s. australia canada japan south korea and new zealand as well as the six members of the association of southeast asian nations thailand malaysia singapore indonesia the philippines and brunei.
in addition the u.s. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the pacific rim in a major speech by secretary of state james baker following up a proposal made in january by australian prime minister bob hawke.
the baker proposal reasserts washington 's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region.
in asia as in europe a new order is taking shape  mr. baker said.
the u.s. with its regional friends must play a crucial role in designing its architecture.
but maintaining u.s. influence will be difficult in the face of japanese dominance in the region.
japan not only outstrips the u.s. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most southeast asian countries although the u.s. remains the leading trade partner for all of asia.
moreover the japanese government now the world 's largest aid donor is pumping far more assistance into the region than the u.s. is.
while u.s. officials voice optimism about japan 's enlarged role in asia they also convey an undertone of caution.
there 's an understanding on the part of the u.s. that japan has to expand its functions  in asia says j. michael farren undersecretary of commerce for trade.
if they approach it with a benevolent altruistic attitude there will be a net gain for everyone.
some asian nations are apprehensive about washington 's demand that tokyo step up its military spending to ease the u.s. security burden in the region.
the issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the u.s. 's leases on military bases in the philippines and by a possible u.s. troop reduction in south korea.
many asians regard a u.s. presence as a desirable counterweight to japanese influence.
no one wants the u.s. to pick up its marbles and go home  mr. hormats says.
for their part taiwan and south korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the japanese juggernaut.
they do n't want japan to monopolize the region and sew it up  says chong-sik lee professor of east asian politics at the university of pennsylvania.
cathryn rice could hardly believe her eyes.
while giving the comprehensive test of basic skills to ninth graders at greenville high school last march 16 she spotted a student looking at crib sheets.
she had seen cheating before but these notes were uncanny.
a stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance.
at the end of world war ii germany surrendered before japan.
the senate-house conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the house and senate in different forms.
virtually word for word the notes matched questions and answers on the social-studies section of the test the student was taking.
in fact the student had the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section.
the student surrendered the notes but not without a protest.
my teacher said it was ok for me to use the notes on the test  he said.
the teacher in question was nancy yeargin considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school.
confronted mrs. yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low-ability geography classes.
she had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers.
mrs. yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual south carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security.
in september she pleaded guilty and paid a $ 500 fine.
her alternative was 90 days in jail.
her story is partly one of personal downfall.
she was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students but she will probably never teach again.
in her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer ; of colleagues who say she brought them shame ; of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly ; and of school-district officials stunned that despite the bald-faced nature of her actions she became something of a local martyr.
mrs. yeargin 's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform where pressures on teachers are growing and where high-stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat.
the 1987 statute mrs. yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of south carolina 's school-improvement laws.
prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students ' scores to win a bonus under the state 's 1984 education improvement act.
the bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student-test scores.
there is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores  says walt haney an education professor and testing specialist at boston college.
so efforts * to beat the tests are also on the rise.
and most disturbing it is educators not students who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing.
a 50-state study released in september by friends for education an albuquerque n.m. school-research group concluded that  outright cheating by american educators  is  common.
the group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often  teach the test  as mrs. yeargin did although most are never caught.
evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so.
california 's education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test.
after numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students texas is revising its security practices.
and sales of test-coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming.
these materials including macmillan/mcgraw-hill school publishing co. 's scoring high and learning materials are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets according to some recent academic research.
by using them teachers with administrative blessing telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers.
use of scoring high is widespread in south carolina and common in greenville county mrs. yeargin 's school district.
experts say there is n't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in south carolina.
under the state 's education improvement act low test scores can block students ' promotions or force entire districts into wrenching state-supervised  interventions  that can mean firings.
high test scores on the other hand bring recognition and extra money a new computer lab for a school grants for special projects a bonus for the superintendent.
and south carolina says it is getting results.
since the reforms went in place for example no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the scholastic aptitude test than south carolina although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who use the sat as the primary college entrance examination.
critics say south carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much.
friends of education rates south carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating.
says the organization 's founder john cannell prosecuting mrs. yeargin is  a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all.
paul sandifer director of testing for the south carolina department of education says mr. cannell 's allegations of cheating  are purely without foundation  and based on unfair inferences.
partly because of worries about potential abuse however he says the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement-test preparation booklets next spring.
south carolina 's reforms were designed for schools like greenville high school.
standing on a shaded hill in a run-down area of this old textile city the school has educated many of south carolina 's best and brightest including the state 's last two governors nobel prize winning physicist charles townes and actress joanne woodward.
but by the early 1980s its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade.
it was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class  says linda ward the school 's principal.
crime was awful test scores were low and there was no enrollment in honors programs.
mrs. ward took over in 1986 becoming the school 's seventh principal in 15 years.
her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown.
prior to his term a teacher bled to death in the halls stabbed by a student.
academically mrs. ward says the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two disparate and evenly split student groups : a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks many of them poor from run-down inner city neighborhoods.
mrs. ward resolved to clean out  deadwood  in the school 's faculty and restore safety and she also had some new factors working in her behalf.
one was statewide school reform which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment.
another was nancy yeargin who came to greenville in 1985 full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward.
being a teacher just became my life  says the 37-year-old mrs. yeargin a teacher for 12 years before her dismissal.
i loved the school its history.
i even dreamt about school and new things to do with my students.
while mrs. ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve curriculum mrs. yeargin worked 14-hour days and fast became a student favorite.
in 1986-87 and 1987-88 she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law.
encouraged by mrs. ward mrs. yeargin taught honor students in the state  teacher cadet  program a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career.
she won grant money for the school advised cheerleaders ran the pep club proposed and taught a new  cultural literacy  class in western civilization and was chosen by the school pta as  teacher of the year.
she was an inspirational lady ; she had it all together  says laura dobson a freshman at the university of south carolina who had mrs. yeargin in the teacher-cadet class last year.
she says that because of mrs. yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher.
mary beth marchand a greenville 11th grader also says mrs. yeargin inspired her to go into education.
she taught us more in western civilization than i 've ever learned in other classes  says kelli green a greenville senior.
in the classroom students say mrs. yeargin distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using college-bowl type competitions.
on weekends she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes even to polish the furniture in her classroom.
she just never gave it up  says mary marchand mary beth 's mother.
you 'd see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game.
some fellow teachers however viewed mrs. yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students.
mrs. ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander.
pressures began to build.
friends told her she was pushing too hard.
because of deteriorating hearing she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer.
mrs. yeargin 's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state 's incentive-bonus program.
but the most important source of points was student improvement on tests.
huge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of $ 5,000 in bonuses over two years a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $ 23,000.
winning a bonus for a third year was n't that important to her mrs. yeargin insists.
but others at greenville high say she was eager to win if not for money then for pride and recognition.
mary elizabeth ariail another social-studies teacher says she believed mrs. yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing.
indeed mrs. yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program.
last march after attending a teaching seminar in washington mrs. yeargin says she returned to greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she had n't prepared her low-ability geography students adequately.
when test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students.
mrs. yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct.
i was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation  she says.
only five of the 40 questions were geography questions.
the rest were history sociology finance subjects they never had.
mrs. yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift greenville high school 's overall test scores usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers.
mostly she says she wanted to prevent the damage to self-esteem that her low-ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test.
these kids broke my heart  she says.
a whole day goes by and no one even knows they 're alive.
they desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them who loved them.
the last thing they needed was another drag-down blow.
school officials and prosecutors say mrs. yeargin is lying.
they found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help although because the case was n't tried in court this evidence was never presented publicly.
that pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child  says joe watson the prosecutor in the case who is also president of greenville high school 's alumni association.
mrs. yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class adding :  i wanted to help all  students.
mr. watson says mrs. yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair.
do i have much sympathy for her ?
mr. watson asks.
not really.
i believe in the system.
i believe you have to use the system to change it.
what she did was like taking the law into your own hands.
mrs. ward says that when the cheating was discovered she wanted to avoid the morale-damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring.
she says she offered mrs. yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate.
mrs. yeargin declined.
she said something like  you just want to make it easy for the school'.
i was dumbfounded  mrs. ward recalls.
it was like someone had turned a knife in me.
to the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests mrsyeargin won widespread local support.
the school-board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf.
supportive callers decried unfair testing not mrs. yeargin on a local radio talk show on which she appeared.
the show did n't give the particulars of mrs. yeargin 's offense saying only that she helped students do better on the test.
the message to the board of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we 're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state  said the talk-show host.
editorials in the greenville newspaper allowed that mrs. yeargin was wrong but also said the case showed how testing was being overused.
the radio show  enraged us  says mrs. ward.
partly because of the show mr. watson says the district decided not to recommend mrs. yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record.
and legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case.
over 50 witnesses mostly students were interviewed.
at greenville high school meanwhile some students especially on the cheerleading squad were crushed.
it 's hard to explain to a 17-year-old why someone they like had to go  says mrs. ward.
soon t-shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school 's familiar red-and-white ghs logo on the front.
on the back the shirts read  we have all the answers.
many colleagues are angry at mrs. yeargin.
she did a lot of harm  says cathryn rice who had discovered the crib notes.
we work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us.
but several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores.
says gayle key a mathematics teacher  the incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms.
there may be others doing what she did.
mrs. yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement and because she was afraid of further charges.
mrs. ward for one was relieved.
despite the strong evidence against mrs. yeargin popular sentiment was so strong in her favor mrs. ward says that  i 'm afraid a jury would n't have convicted her.
since chalk first touched slate schoolchildren have wanted to know : what 's on the test ?
these days students can often find the answer in test-coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests.
the mathematics section of the widely used california achievement test asks fifth graders :  what is another name for the roman numeral ix ?
it also asks them to add two-sevenths and three-sevenths.
worksheets in a test-practice kit called learning materials sold to schools across the country by macmillan/mcgraw-hill school publishing co. contain the same questions.
in many other instances there is almost no difference between the real test and learning materials.
what 's more the test and learning materials are both produced by the same company macmillan/mcgraw-hill a joint venture of mcgraw-hill inc. and macmillan 's parent britain 's maxwell communication corp.
close parallels between tests and practice tests are common some educators and researchers say *t*-1.
test-preparation booklets software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry.
but some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of school-sponsored cheating.
if i took -lcb- these preparation booklets -rcb- into my classroom i 'd have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it was n't cheating  says john kaminski a traverse city mich. teacher who has studied test coaching.
he and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests which is to gauge learning progress.
it 's as if france decided to give only french history questions to students in a european history class and when everybody aces the test *t*-3 they say their kids are good in european history  says john cannell an albuquerque n.m. psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization friends for education which has studied standardized testing.
standardized achievement tests are given about 10 million times a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade.
the most widely used of these tests are macmillan/mcgraw 's cat and comprehensive test of basic skills ; the iowa test of basic skills by houghton mifflin co. ; and harcourt brace jovanovich inc. 's metropolitan achievement test and stanford achievement test.
sales figures of the test-prep materials are n't known but their reach into schools is significant.
in arizona california florida louisiana maryland new jersey south carolina and texas educators say they are common classroom tools.
macmillan/mcgraw says  well over 10 million  of its scoring high test-preparation books have been sold since their introduction 10 years ago with most sales in the last five years.
about 20,000 sets of learning materials teachers ' binders have also been sold in the past four years.
the materials in each set reach about 90 students.
scoring high and learning materials are the best-selling preparation tests.
michael kean director of marketing for ctb macmillan/mcgraw the macmillan/mcgraw division that publishes learning materials says it is n't aimed at improving test scores.
he also asserted that exact questions were n't replicated.
when referred to the questions that matched he said it was coincidental.
mr. kaminski the schoolteacher and william mehrens a michigan state university education professor concluded in a study last june that cat test versions of scoring high and learning materials should n't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test.
they devised a 69-point scale awarding one point for each subskill measured on the cat test to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth-grade cat.
because many of these subskills the symmetry of geometrical figures metric measurement of volume or pie and bar graphs for example are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum mr. kaminski says the preparation kits would n't replicate too many if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures.
but learning materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills.
scoring high matched on 64.5.
in cat sections where students ' knowledge of two-letter consonant sounds is tested the authors noted that scoring high concentrated on the same sounds that the test does to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know.
learning materials for the fifth-grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items.
rick brownell senior editor of scoring high says that messrs. kaminski and mehrens are ignoring  the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format.
he said authors of scoring high  scrupulously avoid  replicating exact questions but he does n't deny that some items are similar.
when scoring high first came out in 1979 it was a publication of random house.
mcgraw-hill was outraged.
in a 1985 advisory to educators mcgraw-hill said scoring high should n't be used because it represented a  parallel form  of the cat and ctbs tests.
but in 1988 mcgraw-hill purchased the random house unit that publishes scoring high which later became part of macmillan/mcgraw.
messrs. brownell and kean say they are unaware of any efforts by mcgraw-hill to modify or discontinue scoring high.
alleghany corp. said it completed the acquisition of sacramento savings & loan association from the h.n. & frances c. berger foundation for $ 150 million.
the sacramento-based s&l which has 44 branch offices in north central california had assets of $ 2.4 billion at the end of september.
new york-based alleghany is an insurance and financial services concern.
the purchase price includes two ancillary companies.
the department of health and human services plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants.
medical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as alzheimer 's parkinson 's and huntington 's.
but anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions.
james mason assistant secretary for health said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research  should be continued indefinitely.
he said the ban wo n't stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that does n't involve transplants.
department officials say that hhs secretary louis sullivan will support dr. mason 's ruling which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the national institutes of health.
both dr. mason and dr. sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion as does president bush except in cases where a woman 's life is threatened.
the controversy began in 1987 when the national institutes of health aware of the policy implications of its research asked for an hhs review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from parkinson 's disease.
the department placed a moratorium on the research pending a review of scientific legal and ethical issues.
a majority of an nih-appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions but the issue became embroiled *-2 in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding.
the dispute has hampered the administration 's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the nih and the centers for disease control.
several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants.
antonio novello whom mr. bush nominated to serve as surgeon general reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion.
dr. novello is deputy director of the national institute of child health and human development.
some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts.
earlier this week dr. sullivan tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the nih and the cdc will be judged by  standards of scientific and administrative excellence  not politics.
but the administration 's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists.
when scientific progress moves into uncharted ground there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications  says myron genel associate dean of the yale medical school.
the disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized so that no mechanism exists  for finding a middle ground.
yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants.
but dr. genel warns that dr. mason 's ruling may discourage private funding.
the unavailability of federal funds and the climate in which the decision was made certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support  he said.
despite the flap over transplants federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts.
such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer  or to regulate genes that cause down 's syndrome the leading cause of mental retardation according to an nih summary.
the nih currently spends about $ 8 million annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $ 8 billion.
rekindled hope that two new england states will allow broader interstate banking boosted nasdaq 's bank stocks but the over-the-counter market was up only slightly in lackluster trading.
the nasdaq composite index added 1.01 to 456.64 on paltry volume of 118.6 million shares.
in terms of volume it was an inauspicious beginning for november.
yesterday 's share turnover was well below the year 's daily average of 133.8 million.
in october the busiest month of the year so far daily volume averaged roughly 145 million shares.
the nasdaq 100 index of the biggest nonfinancial stocks gained 1.39 to 446.62.
the index of the 100 largest nasdaq financial stocks rose modestly as well gaining 1.28 to 449.04.
but the broader nasdaq bank index which tracks thrift issues jumped 3.23 to 436.01.
the bank stocks got a boost when connecticut bank & trust and bank of new england said they no longer oppose pending legislation that would permit banks from other regions to merge with connecticut and massachusetts banks.
the two banks merged in 1985.
bank of new england 's shares are traded on the new york stock exchange.
the stocks of banking concerns based in massachusetts were n't helped much by the announcement traders said because many of those concerns have financial problems tied to their real-estate loan portfolios making them unattractive takeover targets.
but speculators anticipating that connecticut will approve a law permitting such interstate banking soon immediately bid up shares of connecticut banks on the news.
a lot of the stocks that have been under water finally saw a reason to uptick  said george jennison head trader of banking issues in shearson lehman hutton 's otc department.
the biggest beneficiary was northeast bancorp which surged 7 3/4 to 69.
the stamford conn. concern has agreed to a buy-out by bank of new york in a transaction with an indicated value of about $ 100 a share that expires next august.
ed macheski a wilton conn. money manager who follows bank stocks said the announcement effectively gives the deal  the green light.
mr. jennison said northeast bancorp also fared well because takeover stocks have returned to favor among investors.
another otc bank stock involved in a buy-out deal first constitution financial was higher.
it rose 7/8 to 18 1/4.
first constitution has signed a merger agreement with wfrr l.p. and ghkm corp. under which all of its common shares will be acquired for $ 25 each or $ 273.5 million.
among other connecticut banks whose shares trade in the otc market society for savings bancorp based in hartford saw its stock rise 1 3/4 to 18 1/4.
centerbank added 5/8 to 8 3/4 ; shares of nesb a new london-based bank holding company rose 5/8 to 5 7/8.
among other banking issues pennview savings association leapt more than 44  with a gain of 6 5/8 to 21 5/8.
the pennsylvania bank agreed to be acquired in a merger with univest corp. of pennsylvania for $ 25.50 a share.
valley federal savings & loan a california thrift issue gained 1 to 4 1/4 after reporting a third-quarter loss of $ 70.7 million after an $ 89.9 million pretax charge mostly related to its mobile home financing unit.
dan e. nelms valley federal 's president and chief executive officer said the one-time charge substantially eliminates future losses associated with the unit.
he said the company 's core business remains strong.
he also said that after the charges and  assuming no dramatic fluctuation in interest rates the company expects to achieve near-record earnings in 1990.
weisfield 's surged 6 3/4 to 55 1/2 and ratners group 's american depositary receipts or adrs gained 5/8 to 12 1/4.
the two concerns said they entered into a definitive merger agreement under which ratners will begin a tender offer for all of weisfield 's common shares for $ 57.50 each.
also on the takeover front jaguar 's adrs rose 1/4 to 13 7/8 on turnover of 4.4 million.
since the british auto maker became a takeover target last month its adrs have jumped about 78.
after troubled heritage media proposed acquiring pop radio in a stock swap pop radio 's shares tumbled 4 to 14 3/4.
heritage media which already owns about 51  of pop radio proposed paying pop radio shareholders with shares of a new class of heritage media preferred stock that would be convertible into four shares of heritage media 's common.
rally 's lost 1 3/4 to 21 3/4.
the restaurant operator said it has redeemed its rights issued monday under its shareholder rights plan.
the fast-food company said its decision was based *-1 on discussions with a shareholder group giant group ltd.  in an effort to resolve certain disputes with the company.
giant group is led by three rally 's directors burt sugarman james m. trotter iii and william e. trotter ii who earlier this month indicated they had a 42.5  stake in rally 's and planned to seek a majority of seats on rally 's nine-member board.
sci systems slipped 7/8 to 10 on volume of 858,000 shares.
the huntsville ala. electronic products maker said it expects to post a  significant  loss for its fiscal first quarter ended sept. 30.
in the year-earlier period sci had net income of $ 4.8 million or 23 cents a share on revenue of $ 225.6 million.
the internal revenue service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $ 10,000 in cash.
the warnings issued to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar who claim the information is protected by attorney-client privilege.
the irs warnings stem from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than $ 10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions  in the course of trade or business  to report the payment on a document known as form 8300.
the form asks for such details as the client 's name social security number passport number and details about the services provided for the payment.
failure to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last november when congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
attorneys have argued since 1985 when the law took effect that they can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their identities to be known.
many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the irs in recent years citing attorney-client privilege.
until last week the irs rarely acted on the incomplete forms.
this form forces a lawyer to become in effect a witness against his client  said neal r. sonnett president of the national association of criminal defense lawyers.
the irs is asking lawyers to red-flag a criminal problem to the government  added mr. sonnett a miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer-generated irs forms sent by certified mail.
mr. sonnett said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts.
these individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers.
mr. sonnett said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers.
filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the irs off and spark action against the clients he said.
the defense lawyers ' group formed a task force this week chaired by new york attorney gerald lefcourt to deal with the matter.
the american bar association 's house of delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the irs reporting requirement.
michael ross a new york lawyer who heads the aba 's grand jury committee said that lawyers are prohibited by the aba 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death.
mr. ross said he met with officials of the irs and the justice department which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers to discuss the issue last may.
at that meeting he said the justice department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice.
mr. ross said irs officials opposed the justice department 's moderate stance on the matter.
but in the letters sent in recent days christopher j. lezovich of the irs computing center in detroit told attorneys that  failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated.
in some cases the irs asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985.
a spokesman for the irs confirmed that  there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s  but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now.
individuals familiar with the justice department 's policy said that justice officials had n't any knowledge of the irs 's actions in the last week.
lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors.
prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business.
but they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases.
some criminal lawyers speculated that the irs was sending the letters to test the issue.
in a number of recent cases federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys ' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential.
the war over federal judicial salaries takes a victim.
often judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare but not federal judge raul a. ramirez in sacramento calif.
on tuesday the judge called a news conference to say he was quitting effective dec. 31 to join a san francisco law firm.
the reason : the refusal of congress to give federal judges a raise.
a couple of my law clerks were going to pass me in three or four years and i was afraid i was going to have to ask them for a loan  the judge quipped in an interview.
federal judges make $ 89,500 annually ; in february congress rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by 50.
judge ramirez 44 said it is unjust for judges to make what they do.
judges are not getting what they deserve.
you look around at professional ballplayers or accountants  and nobody blinks an eye.
when you become a federal judge all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum.
at his new job as partner in charge of federal litigation in the sacramento office of orrick herrington & sutcliffe he will make out much better.
the judge declined to discuss his salary in detail but said :  i 'm going to be a high-priced lawyer.
doonesbury creator's union troubles are no laughing matter.
cartoonist garry trudeau is suing the writers guild of america east for $ 11 million alleging it mounted a  campaign to harass and punish  him for crossing a screenwriters ' picket line.
the dispute involves darkhorse productions inc. a tv production company in which mr. trudeau is a co-owner.
mr. trudeau a writers guild member also was employed as a writer for darkhorse which was covered by a guild collective-bargaining agreement.
the guild began a strike against the tv and movie industry in march 1988.
in his lawsuit mr. trudeau says the strike illegally included darkhorse and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company.
a spokesman for the guild said the union 's lawyers are reviewing the suit.
he said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against mr. trudeau.
mr. trudeau 's attorney norman k. samnick said the harassment consists mainly of the guild 's year-long threats of disciplinary action.
mr. samnick said a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next monday in new york.
mr. samnick who will go before the disciplinary panel said the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified.
in addition to the damages the suit seeks a court order preventing the guild from punishing or retaliating against mr. trudeau.
abortion ruling upheld : a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that the u.s. can bar the use of federal funds for family-planning programs that include abortion-related services.
a department of health and human services rule adopted in 1988 prohibits the use of so-called title x funds for programs that assist a woman in obtaining an abortion such as abortion counseling and referrals.
the rule also prohibits funding for activities that  encourage promote or advocate abortion.
title x funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family-planning services according to the opinion by the second u.s. circuit court of appeals in new york.
the panel ruled that the restrictions do n't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services do n't violate the rights of pregnant women.
inquiry clears texas judge of bias in comments on homosexual murder victims.
dallas district judge jack hampton had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last december two weeks after sentencing an 18-year-old defendant to 30 years in state prison for killing two homosexual men in a city park.
the judge was quoted as referring to the victims as  queers  and saying they would n't have been killed  if they had n't been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys.
but robert r. murray a special master appointed by the texas supreme court said judge hampton did n't breach any judicial standards of fairness although he did violate the state 's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case.
observing that the judge  has never exhibited any bias or prejudice  mr. murray concluded that he  would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute  as a victim.
mr. murray also said judge hampton 's comments did n't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice.
the report is subject to review by the state commission on judicial conduct which is empowered to impose sanctions.
gaf trial goes to round three.
attorneys in the third stock-manipulation trial of gaf corp. began opening arguments yesterday in the manhattan courtroom of u.s. district judge mary johnson lowe.
in an eight-count indictment the government has charged gaf a wayne n.j. specialty chemical maker and its vice chairman james t. sherwin with attempting to manipulate the common stock of union carbide corp. in advance of gaf 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in november 1986.
the first two gaf trials ended in mistrials earlier this year.
this trial is expected to last five weeks.

fujitsu ltd. 's top executive took the unusual step of publicly apologizing for his company 's making bids of just one yen for several local government projects while computer rival nec corp. made a written apology for indulging in the same practice.
meanwhile business and government leaders rebuked the computer makers and fretted about the broader statement the companies ' actions make about japanese cutthroat pricing.
fujitsu said it bid the equivalent of less than a u.s. penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years.
the company also disclosed that during that period it offered 10,000 yen or about $ 70 for another contract.
but fujitsu japan 's no. 1 computer maker is n't alone.
nec one of its largest domestic competitors said it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987.
in both cases nec lost the contract to fujitsu which made the same bid and won a tie-breaking lottery.
all the contracts were for computer-system-design contracts and involved no hardware or software.
the ministry of international trade and industry summoned executives from the companies to  make sure they understood  the concern about such practices according to a government spokesman.
these cases lead to the loss of the firms ' social and international credibility  a ministry statement said.
japan 's fair trade commission has said it is considering investigating the bids for possible antitrust-law violations.
we would like to apologize for having caused huge trouble  fujitsu president takuma yamamoto read from a prepared statement as he stood before a packed news conference at his company 's downtown headquarters.
the bids he added were  contrary to common sense.
nec released a statement saying  we feel sorry for having caused trouble to society  a form of apology common in japan for companies caught in embarrassing situations.
japanese companies have long had a reputation for sacrificing short-term profits to make a sale that may have long-term benefits.
but the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having extramarital affairs are coming under close ethical scrutiny.
the fire is also fueled by growing international interest in japanese behavior.
so far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue.
but in one of the auctions in question international business machines corp. made a bid substantially higher than the fujitsu offer according to the municipality.
the low-ball bids touch on issues central to the increasingly tense trade debate.
foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in japan in part because japanese companies unfairly undercut them.
the u.s. government in recent years has accused japanese companies of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers products fujitsu and nec make.
asked whether the bidding flap would hurt u.s.-japan relations mr. yamamoto said  this will be a minus factor.
the  one-yen  controversy first came to a head last week when the city of hiroshima announced that fujitsu won a contract to design a computer system to map its waterworks.
the city had expected to pay about 11 million yen $ 77,000 but fujitsu essentially offered to do it for free.
then wednesday fujitsu said it made a similar bid to win a library contract in nagano prefecture two weeks earlier.
it also said that in july it bid 10,000 yen to design a system for the saitama prefectural library and two years ago it bid one yen to plan the telecommunications system for wakayama prefecture.
the company said it has offered to withdraw its bids in hiroshima and nagano.
the municipalities said they have n't decided whether to try to force the company to go through with the contracts.
fujitsu and nec said they were still investigating and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge.
mr. yamamoto insisted that headquarters had n't approved the bids and that he did n't know about most of the cases until wednesday.
other major japanese computer companies contacted yesterday said they have never made such bids.
one yen is not ethical  michio sasaki an official at keidanren the japan federation of economic organizations said.
profit may be low but at least costs should be covered.
papers : backe group inc. agreed to acquire atlantic publications inc. which has 30 community papers and annual sales of $ 7 million.

backe is a closely held media firm run by former cbs inc. president john backe.
tv : price communications corp. completed the sale of four of its tv stations to ntg inc. for $ 120 million in cash and notes retaining a 10  equity stake in the new concern.
ntg was formed by osborn communications corp. and desai capital.
michaels stores inc. which owns and operates a chain of specialty retail stores said october sales rose 14.6  to $ 32.8 million from $ 28.6 million a year earlier.
sales in stores open more than one year rose 3  to $ 29.3 million from $ 28.4 million.
furukawa co. of japan said it will acquire two construction machinery plants and a sales unit in france formerly belonging to dresser industries inc. of the u.s.
the company said it made the purchase in order to locally produce hydraulically operated shovels.
last october the company also bought a wheel-loader manufacturing plant in heidelberg west germany from dresser.
furukawa said the purchase of the french and german plants together will total about 40 billion yen $ 280 million.
structural dynamics research corp. which makes computer-aided engineering software said it introduced new technology in mechanical design automation that will improve mechanical engineering productivity.

lsi logic corp. reported a surprise $ 35.7 million third-quarter net loss including a special restructuring charge that reflects a continuing industry-wide slowdown in semiconductor demand.
in september the custom-chip maker said excess capacity and lagging billings would result in an estimated $ 2 million to $ 3 million net loss for the third quarter.
but company officials said yesterday that they decided to take a $ 43 million pretax charge for the period to cover a restructuring of world-wide manufacturing operations citing extended weakness in the market as well as a decision to switch to more economical production techniques.
over the summer months there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector our primary market  said wilfred j. corrigan chairman and chief executive officer.
in addition recent industry forecasts for 1990 indicate a slow environment at least until midyear.
as a result the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and  make appropriate reductions  in operating expenses.
the $ 35.7 million net loss equals 86 cents a share.
not counting the extraordinary charge the company said it would have had a net loss of $ 3.1 million or seven cents a share.
a year earlier it had profit of $ 7.5 million or 18 cents a share.
revenue rose 42  to $ 133.7 million from $ 94 million.
the charge partly reflects a switch from older five-inch to more-efficient six-inch silicon wafers with which to fabricate chips.
related to that decision the company said it was converting its santa clara calif. factory to a research and development facility.
a spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in force.
this is a company that has invested in capacity additions more aggressively than any other company in the industry and now the industry is growing more slowly and they are suddenly poorly positioned  said michael stark chip analyst at robertson stephens & co.
i think the stock is dead money for a while.
yesterday 's announcement was made after markets closed.
u.s. chip makers are facing continued slack demand following a traditionally slow summer.

the dollar posted gains against all major currencies yesterday buoyed by persistent japanese demand for u.s. bond issues.
while market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish u.s. economic indicators dealers note that japanese demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the u.s. currency from plunging below key levels against the mark.
at the same time dealers said the u.s. unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks in part because the hefty japanese demand for dollars has been offset by the mark 's strength resulting in a stalemate.
jay goldinger with capital insight inc. reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well the mark climbed to 77.70 yen from 77.56 yen late tuesday in new york the strength of the u.s. bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar-denominated bonds rather than mark bonds.
dollar-yen -lcb- trade -rcb- is the driving force in the market  said tom trettien a vice president with banque paribas in new york  but i 'm not convinced it will continue.
who knows what will happen down the road in three to six months if foreign investment starts to erode ?
in late new york trading yesterday the dollar was quoted at 1.8500 marks up from 1.8415 marks late tuesday and at 143.80 yen up from 142.85 yen late tuesday.
sterling was quoted at $ 1.5755 down from $ 1.5805 late tuesday.
in tokyo thursday the u.s. currency opened for trading at 143.93 yen up from wednesday 's tokyo close of 143.08 yen.
douglas madison a corporate trader with bank of america in los angeles traced the dollar 's recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings.
he contends that the perception in japan of a vitriolic u.s. response to sony corp. 's announcement of its purchase of columbia pictures entertainment inc. has been temporarily mollified.
he cites the recent deal between the mitsubishi estate co. and the rockefeller group as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed japanese company in the georgia-pacific corp. takeover bid for great northern nekoosa corp. as evidence.
the forthcoming maturity in november of a 10-year japanese government yen-denominated bond issue valued at about $ 16 billion has prompted speculation in the market that investors redeeming the bonds will diversify into dollar-denominated instruments according to mr. madison.
it remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled over.
meanwhile traders in tokyo say that the prospect of lower u.s. interest rates has spurred dollar buying by japanese institutions.
they point out that these institutions want to lock in returns on high-yield u.s. treasury debt and suggest demand for the u.s. unit will continue unabated until rates in the u.s. recede.
the market again showed little interest in further evidence of a slowing u.s. economy and traders note that the market in recent weeks has taken its cues more from wall street than u.s. economic indicators.
dealers said the dollar merely drifted lower following the release wednesday of the u.s. purchasing managers ' report.
the managers ' index which measures the health of the manufacturing sector stood at 47.6  in october above september 's 46  and also above average forecasts for the index of 45.3.
some dealers said the dollar was pressured slightly because a number of market participants had boosted their expectations in the past day and were looking for an index above 50 which indicates an expanding manufacturing economy.
but most said the index had no more than a minimal effect on trade.

the cosby show  may have single-handedly turned around ratings at nbc since its debut in 1984 and the huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing thursday night on the network.
but some of the tv stations that bought  cosby  reruns for record prices two years ago are n't laughing much these days.
the reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent tv stations that air the shows.
but the ratings are considerably below expectations and some stations say they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire.
meanwhile stations are fuming because many of them say the show 's distributor viacom inc. is giving an ultimatum : either sign new long-term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing  cosby  to a competitor.
at the same time viacom is trying to persuade stations to make commitments to  a different world  a spin-off of  cosby  whose reruns will become available in 1991.
viacom denies it 's using pressure tactics.
we 're willing to negotiate  says dennis gillespie executive vice president of marketing.
we 're offering this plan now because we feel it 's the right time.
but says the general manager of a network affiliate in the midwest  i think if i tell them i need more time they 'll take  cosby ' across the street  viacom 's move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks.
one station manager says he believes viacom 's move is a  pre-emptive strike  because the company is worried that  cosby  ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years.
cosby  is down a full ratings point in the week of oct. 2-8 over the same week a year ago according to a.c. nielsen co.
mr. gillespie at viacom says the ratings are rising.
and executives at stations in such major markets as washington ; providence r.i. ; cleveland ; raleigh n.c. ; minneapolis and louisville ky. say they may very well not renew  cosby.
dick lobo the general manager of wtvj the nbc-owned station in miami for example says the show has  been a major disappointment to us.
at the prices we were charged there should have been some return for the dollar.
there was n't.
neil kuvin the general manager of whas the cbs affiliate in louisville says  cosby  gets the station 's highest ratings and he 's  pleased.
but he adds  i feel pressured disappointed uncomfortable and frankly quite angry with viacom.

in this era of frantic competition for ad dollars a lot of revenue-desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space.
so can a magazine survive by downright thumbing its nose at major advertisers ?
garbage magazine billed as  the practical journal for the environment  is about to find out.
founded by brooklyn n.y. publishing entrepreneur patricia poore garbage made its debut this fall with the promise to give consumers the straight scoop on the u.s. waste crisis.
the magazine combines how-to pieces on topics like backyard composting explanatory essays on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet and hard-hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders.
garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate america 's good guys and bad boys.
in one feature called  in the dumpster  editors point out a product they deem to be a particularly bad offender.
from an advertising standpoint the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days.
with only two issues under its belt garbage has alienated some would-be advertisers and raised the ire of others.
campbell soup for one is furious its souper combo microwave product was chastised in the premiere  in the dumpster  column.
the magazine 's editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging 's polystyrene foam polyproplene and polyester film all plastic items they say are non-biodegradable.
it 's precisely the kind of product that 's created the municipal landfill monster  the editors wrote.
i think that this magazine is not only called *-1 garbage but it is practicing journalistic garbage  fumes a spokesman for campbell soup.
he says campbell was n't even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment.
modifications had been made to the souper combo product at the time the issue was printed he says making it less an offender than was portrayed.
he admits though it is n't one of campbell soup 's better products in terms of recyclability.
campbell soup not surprisingly does n't have any plans to advertise in the magazine according to its spokesman.
some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off madison avenue 's big spenders.
you really need the campbell soups of the world to be interested in your magazine if you 're going to make a run of it  says mike white senior vice president and media director at ddb needham chicago.
the economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base  of big-time ad spenders he adds.
the first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers including general electric and adolph coors but the majority were from companies like waste management inc. and bumkins international firms that do n't spend much money advertising and ca n't be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul.
a waste management spokeswoman says its ad in the premiere issue was a one-time purchase and it does n't have any plans * to advertise in future issues.
we do n't spend much on print advertising  she says.
but ms. poore the magazine 's editor and publisher contends garbage can survive at least initially on subscription revenues.
individual copies of the magazine sell for $ 2.95 and yearly subscriptions cost $ 21.
it is of course printed on recycled paper.
according to ms. poore old-house journal corp. her publishing company printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue.
the first and second issues sold out on newsstands she says and the magazine has orders for 93,000 subscriptions.
asked whether potential advertisers will be scared away by the magazine 's direct policy ms. poore replies :  i do n't know and i do n't care.
i 'm not saying advertising revenue is n't important  she says  but i could n't sleep at night  if the magazine bowed to a company because they once took out an ad.

sea containers ltd. said it might increase the price of its $ 70-a-share buy-back plan if pressed by temple holdings ltd. which made an earlier tender offer for sea containers.
sea containers a hamilton bermuda-based shipping concern said tuesday that it would sell $ 1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50  of its common shares for $ 70 apiece.
the move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two european shipping concerns stena holding ag and tiphook plc.
in may the two companies through their jointly owned holding company temple offered $ 50 a share or $ 777 million for sea containers.
in august temple sweetened the offer to $ 63 a share or $ 963 million.
yesterday sea containers ' chief executive officer james sherwood said in an interview that under the asset-sale plan sea containers would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $ 620 million.
about $ 490 million of that would be allocated to the buy-back leaving about $ 130 million he said.
that $ 130 million mr. sherwood said  gives us some flexibility in case temple raises its bid.
we are able to increase our price above the $ 70 level if necessary.
he declined to say however how much sea containers might raise its price.
mr. sherwood speculated that the leeway that sea containers has means that temple would have to  substantially increase their bid if they 're going to top us.
temple however harshly criticized sea containers ' plan yesterday characterizing it as a  highly conditional device designed to entrench management confuse shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer.
a spokesman for temple estimated that sea containers ' plan if all the asset sales materialize would result in shareholders receiving only $ 36 to $ 45 a share in cash.
the lower figures the spokesman said would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that sea containers ' subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market.
temple added that sea containers is still mired in legal problems in bermuda where the supreme court has temporarily barred sea containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by stena and tiphook.
the court has indicated it will rule on the case by the end of the month.
temple also said sea containers ' plan raises  numerous legal regulatory financial and fairness issues  but did n't elaborate.
mr. sherwood said reaction to sea containers ' proposal has been  very positive.
in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday sea containers closed at $ 62.625 up 62.5 cents.
the transportation department responding to pressure from safety advocates took further steps to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used for automobiles.
the department proposed requiring stronger roofs for light trucks and minivans beginning with 1992 models.
it also issued a final rule requiring auto makers to equip light trucks and minivans with lap-shoulder belts for rear seats beginning in the 1992 model year.
such belts already are required for the vehicles ' front seats.
today 's action  transportation secretary samuel skinner said  represents another milestone in the ongoing program to promote vehicle occupant safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards.
in september the department had said it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped with the same front-seat headrests that have long been required on passenger cars.
the big three auto makers said the rule changes were n't surprising because bush administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans.
safety advocates including some members of congress have been urging the department for years to extend car-safety requirements to light trucks and vans which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the u.s.
they say that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars.
they did n't have much luck during the reagan administration.
but now there seems to be a fairly systematic effort to address the problem  said chuck hurley vice president of communications for the insurance institute for highway safety.
we 're in a very different regulatory environment.
senator john danforth praised the department 's actions noting that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light-truck deaths.
we could prevent many of these fatalities with minimum roof-crush standards  he said.
sen. danforth and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved side-crash protection.
the department 's roof-crush proposal would apply to vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less.
the roofs would be required to withstand a force of 1.5 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle.
during the test the roof could n't be depressed more than five inches.
in detroit a chrysler corp. official said the company currently has no rear-seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year.
he said chrysler fully expects to have them installed across its light-truck line by the sept. 1 1991 deadline.
chrysler said its trucks and vans already meet the roof-crush resistance standard for cars.
john leinonen executive engineer of ford motor co. 's auto-safety office said ford trucks have met car standards for roof-crush resistance since 1982.
ford began installing the rear-seat belts in trucks with its f-series crew cab pickups in the 1989 model year.
the new explorer sport-utility vehicle set for introduction next spring will also have the rear-seat belts.
mr. leinonen said he expects ford to meet the deadline easily.
consolidated rail corp. said it would spend more than $ 30 million on 1,000 enclosed railcars for transporting autos.
the multilevel railcars scheduled for delivery in 1990 will be made *-1 by thrall manufacturing co. a chicago heights ill. division of closely held duchossois industries inc. elmhurst ill.
this year the railroad holding company acquired 850 such railcars.
sir peter walters 58-year-old chairman of british petroleum co. until next march joins the board of this cement products company on dec. 1.
sir peter will succeed sir john milne 65 who retires as blue circle nonexecutive chairman on june 1.
bank of new england corp. said it has held talks with potential merger partners outside new england although it added that nothing is imminent and it has n't received any formal offers.
the discussions were disclosed as the bank holding company said that it has dropped its longstanding opposition to full interstate banking bills in connecticut and in massachusetts.
later yesterday a massachusetts senate committee approved a bill to allow national interstate banking by banks in the state beginning in 1991.
currently both massachusetts and connecticut where most of bank of new england 's operations are allow interstate banking only within new england.
richard driscoll vice chairman of bank of new england told the dow jones professional investor report  certainly there are those outside the region who think of us prospectively as a good partner.
we have and i 'm sure others have considered what our options are and we 've had conversations with people who in the future might prove to be interesting partners.
he added  there 's nothing very hot.
mr. driscoll did n't elaborate about who the potential partners were or when the talks were held.
a bank spokeswoman also declined to comment on any merger-related matters but said the company decided to drop its opposition to the interstate banking legislation because  prevailing sentiment is in favor of passage.
bank of new england has been hit hard by the region 's real-estate slump with its net income declining 42  to $ 121.6 million or 61 cents a share in the first nine months of 1989 from the year-earlier period.
the company recently said it would sell some operations and lay off 4  of its work force altogether reducing employment to less than 16,000 from about 18,000.
it recently signed a preliminary agreement to negotiate exclusively with the bank of tokyo ltd. for the sale of part of its leasing business to the japanese bank.
goody products inc. cut its quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 11.5 cents a share.
the reduced dividend is payable jan. 2 to stock of record dec. 15.
the kearny n.j.-based maker of hair accessories and other cosmetic products said it cut the dividend due to its third-quarter loss of $ 992,000 or 15 cents a share.
in the year-ago quarter the company reported net income of $ 1.9 million or 29 cents a share.
the company also adopted an anti-takeover plan.
michael henderson 51-year-old group chief executive of this u.k. metals and industrial materials maker will become chairman in may succeeding ian butler 64 who is retiring.
mr. butler will remain on the board as a nonexecutive director.
rally 's inc. said it has redeemed its rights outstanding issued monday in its shareholder rights plan.
the company said holders of stock of record nov. 10 will receive 1/10th of one cent a share as the redemption payment.
the fast-food company said its decision was based upon discussions with a shareholder group giant group ltd.  in an effort to resolve certain disputes with the company.
giant group is led by three rally 's directors burt sugarman james m. trotter iii and william e. trotter ii who last month indicated 0 they hold a 42.5  stake in rally 's and plan to seek a majority of seats on rally 's nine-member board.
when warren winiarski proprietor of stag 's leap wine cellars in napa valley announced a $ 75 price tag for his 1985 cask 23 cabernet this fall few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked.
this is the peak of my wine-making experience  mr. winiarski declared when he introduced the wine at a dinner in new york  and i wanted to single it out as such.
it is in my estimation the best wine stag 's leap has produced and with fewer than 700 cases available it is sure to sell quickly.
the price is a new high for california cabernet sauvignon but it is not the highest.
diamond creek 1985 lake vineyard cabernet weighed in this fall with a sticker price of $ 100 a bottle.
one of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums wines limited in production of exceptional quality or so perceived at any rate and with exceedingly high prices.
for years this group included a stable of classics bordeaux first growths lafite-rothschild latour haut-brion petrus grand cru burgundies romanee-conti and la tache deluxe champagnes dom perignon or roederer cristal rarefied sweet wines chateau yquem or trockenbeerenauslesen rieslings from germany and biondi-santi brunello riserva from tuscany.
these first magnitude wines ranged in price from $ 40 to $ 125 a bottle.
in the last year or so however this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members.
the classics have zoomed in price to meet the competition and it almost seems that there 's a race on to come up with the priciest single bottle among current releases from every major wine region on the globe.
france can boast the lion 's share of high-priced bottles.
bordeaux 's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $ 60 to $ 80 each except for the smallest in terms of production chateau petrus which costs around $ 250 !
these prices seem rather modest however in light of other french wines from current vintages.
chateau yquem the leading sauternes now goes for well over $ 100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984 ; the spectacularly rich 1983 runs $ 179.
in champagne some of the prestige cuvees are inching toward $ 100 a bottle.
the first champagne to crack that price barrier was the 1979 salon de mesnil blanc de blancs.
the '82 salon is $ 115.
roederer cristal at $ 90 a bottle sells out around the country and taittinger 's comtes de champagne blanc de blancs is encroaching upon that level.
the great reds of the rhone valley have soared in price as well.
e. guigal 's 1982 cote rotie la landonne for example is $ 120.
none of france 's wine regions can steal a march on burgundy however.
the six wines of the domaine de la romanee-conti 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world have commanded three-digit price tags for several years now.
with the 1985 vintage they soared higher : la tache $ 195 ; richebourg $ 180 ; romanee-conti $ 225.
another small burgundy estate coche-dury has just offered its 1987 corton-charlemagne for $ 155.
from italy there is angelo gaja barbaresco at $ 125 a bottle piero antinori 's la solaia a $ 90 cabernet from tuscany and biondi-santi brunello at $ 98.
spain 's vega secilia unico 1979 released only in its 10th year is $ 70 as is australia 's grange hermitage 1982.
there are certain cult wines that can command these higher prices  says larry shapiro of marty 's one of the largest wine shops in dallas.
what 's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out.
we 're seeing it partly because older vintages are growing more scarce.
wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines mr. shapiro continued :  we 've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the '40s and '50s which go for $ 300 to $ 400 a bottle.
some of the newer wines even at $ 90 to $ 100 a bottle or so almost offer a bargain.
take lake vineyard cabernet from diamond creek.
it 's made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly the last was 1979 and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987.
owner al brownstein originally planned to sell it for $ 60 a bottle but when a retailer in southern california asked  is that wholesale or retail ?  he re-thought the matter.
offering the wine at roughly $ 65 a bottle wholesale $ 100 retail he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers : 1 no the wine is too high 2 responses ; 2 yes it 's high but i 'll take it 2 responses ; 3 i 'll take all i can get 58 responses.
the wine was shipped in six-bottle cases instead of the usual 12 but even at that it was spread thin going to 62 retailers in 28 states.
we thought it was awfully expensive  said sterling pratt wine director at schaefer 's in skokie ill. one of the top stores in suburban chicago  but there are people out there with very different opinions of value.
we got our two six-packs and they 're gone.
mr. pratt remarked that he thinks steeper prices have come about because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on.
even if there is consumer resistance at first a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move.
there may be sticker-shock reaction initially  said mr. pratt  but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection.
it 's just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people  added larry shapiro.
they like to talk about *-2 having the new red rock terrace -lcb- one of diamond creek 's cabernets -rcb- or the dunn 1985 cabernet or the petrus.
producers have seen this market opening up and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people.
that explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly.
but consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago.
they wo n't buy if the quality is not there  said cedric martin of martin wine cellar in new orleans.
or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less.
mr. martin has increased prices on some wines like grgich hills chardonnay now $ 32 just to slow down movement but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red burgundies and cabernets and chardonnays in the $ 30 to $ 40 range.
image has of course a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't and it ca n't be forced.
wine merchants ca n't keep roederer cristal in stock but they have to push salon le mesnil even lowering the price from $ 115 to $ 90.
it 's hardly a question of quality the 1982 salon is a beautiful wine but as mr. pratt noted people have their own ideas about value.
it 's interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines are n't always walking out the door.
in every major market in the u.s. for instance you can buy '86 la tache or richebourg virtually all of the first growth bordeaux except petrus as well as opus one and dominus from california and at the moment the stag 's leap 1985 cask 23.
with the biggest wine-buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare.
by january it should be fairly clear what 's hot and what 's not.

signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure on the federal reserve to cut short-term interest rates but it is n't clear whether the central bank will do so.
a survey by the fed 's 12 district banks shows economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks while upward pressures on prices have moderated.
the economy is clearly slowing  says robert black president of the richmond federal reserve bank.
if you look at the third quarter as posting roughly 2.5  growth i do see some slowing in the fourth quarter  agrees kansas city fed president roger guffey.
nevertheless both mr. guffey and mr. black say the slowdown so far is no cause for concern.
we 're coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur  said mr. guffey.
bush administration officials are looking to the fed to bring down rates and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well.
i think 0 the market had been expecting the fed to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date  said robert johnson vice president of global markets for bankers trust co.
the fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about 0.25 percentage point to 8.75  after the oct. 13 stock market plunge but has shown no sign of movement since.
the report from the fed found that manufacturing in particular has been weak in recent weeks.
the philadelphia fed for instance reported that manufacturing activity  continues to decline  for the fourth month in a row.
and in the chicago district the report said  a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types including defense equipment petroleum equipment food packaging machinery and material handling equipment.
retail sales also were reported slow in most districts particularly  for discretionary big-ticket items such as furniture home appliances and consumer electronics.
and construction also was described as slow in most areas.
despite the economic slowdown there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt.
as a result fed officials may be divided over whether to ease credit.
several fed governors in washington have been pushing for easier credit ; but many of the regional fed presidents have been resisting such a move.
mr. black said he is  pleased  with the economy 's recent performance and does n't see  a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession.
there is always a chance of recession  added mr. guffey  but if you ask me to put a percentage on it i would think it 's well below a 50  chance.
integra-a hotel & restaurant co. said its planned rights offering to raise about $ 9 million was declared effective and the company will begin mailing materials to shareholders at the end of this week.
under the offer shareholders will receive one right for each 105 common shares owned.
each right entitles the shareholder to buy $ 100 face amount of 13.5  bonds due 1993 and warrants to buy 23.5 common shares at 30 cents a share.
the rights which expire nov. 21 can be exercised for $ 100 each.
integra which owns and operates hotels said that hallwood group inc. has agreed to exercise any rights that are n't exercised by other shareholders.
hallwood a cleveland merchant bank owns about 11  of integra.
copperweld corp. a specialty steelmaker said 445 workers at a plant in shelby ohio began a strike after the united steelworkers local 3057 rejected a new contract on tuesday.

the treasury said it plans to sell $ 30 billion in notes and bonds next week but said the auctions will be postponed unless congress acts quickly to lift the federal debt ceiling.
michael basham deputy assistant secretary for federal finance said the treasury may wait until late monday or even early tuesday to announce whether the autions are to be rescheduled.
unless it can raise money in financial markets mr. basham said the federal government wo n't have the cash to pay off $ 13.8 billion in treasury bills that mature on thursday.
without congressional action the treasury ca n't sell any new securities even savings bonds.
but despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling which *t*-177 has become entangled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes congress is almost certain to act in time to avoid default.
each day that congress fails to act  will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer  treasury secretary nicholas brady said in a speech prepared for delivery last night to a group of bankers.
to avoid these costs and a possible default immediate action is imperative.
the securities to be sold next week will raise about $ 10 billion in cash and redeem $ 20 billion in maturing notes.
the new securities part of the federal government 's regular quarterly refunding will consist of : $ 10 billion of three-year notes to be auctioned tuesday and to mature nov. 15 1992.
$ 10 billion of 10-year notes to be auctioned wednesday and to mature nov. 15 1999.
$ 10 billion of 30-year bonds to be auctioned thursday and to mature aug. 15 2019.
the treasury also said 0 it plans to sell $ 10 billion in 36-day cash management bills on thursday.
they will mature dec. 21.
none of the securities will be eligible for when-issued trading until congress approves an increase in the debt ceiling clearing the way for a formal offering mr. basham said.
the treasury said it needs to raise $ 47.5 billion in the current quarter in order to end december with a $ 20 billion cash balance.
auctions held in october and those scheduled for next week will raise a total of $ 25.6 billion.
the remaining $ 21.9 billion could be raised through the sale of short-term treasury bills two-year notes in november and five-year notes in early december the treasury said.
in the first three months of 1990 the treasury estimates that it will have to raise between $ 45 billion and $ 50 billion assuming that it decides to aim for a $ 10 billion cash balance at the end of march.

the industrial average jumped more than 41 points tuesday as speculators rushed to buy shares of potential takeover targets.
but with the end of the year in sight money managers are eager to take profits and cut their risks of losing what for many have been exceptionally good returns in economic news had little effect on financial markets.

investor harold simmons and nl industries inc. offered to acquire georgia gulf corp. for $ 50 a share or about $ 1.1 billion stepping up the pressure on the commodity chemicals concern.
the offer follows an earlier proposal by nl and mr. simmons to help georgia gulf restructure or go private in a transaction that would pay shareholders $ 55 a share.
georgia gulf rebuffed that offer in september and said it would study other alternatives.
however it has n't yet made any proposals to shareholders.
late yesterday georgia gulf said it reviewed the nl proposal as well as interests from  third parties  regarding business combinations.
georgia gulf said it has n't eliminated any alternatives and that  discussions are being held with interested parties and work is also continuing on other various transactions.
it did n't elaborate.
analysts saw the latest offer as proof that mr. simmons an aggressive and persistent investor wo n't leave georgia gulf alone until some kind of transaction is completed.
he has clamped on their ankle like a pit bull  says paul leming a vice president with morgan stanley & co.
he appears to be in it for the long haul.
mr. simmons and nl already own a 9.9  stake in georgia gulf.
mr. simmons owns 88  of valhi inc. which in turn owns two-thirds of nl.
nl is officially making the offer.
mr. leming was n't surprised by the lower price cited by nl saying he believes that $ 55 a share is  the most you can pay for georgia gulf before it becomes a bad acquisition.
georgia gulf stock rose $ 1.75 a share yesterday to close at $ 51.25 a share while nl shares closed unchanged at $ 22.75 and valhi rose 62.5 cents to $ 15 all in new york stock exchange composite trading.
j. landis martin nl president and chief executive officer said nl and mr. simmons cut the price they were proposing for georgia gulf because they initially planned a transaction that included about $ 250 million in equity and a substantial amount of high-yield subordinated debt.
however the junk-bond market has collapsed in recent weeks lessening the likelihood that such a transaction would succeed.
now he said the group plans to put in  several hundred million  dollars in equity and finance the remainder with bank debt.
he also said that the group reduced its offer because it was n't allowed to see georgia gulf 's confidential financial information without agreeing that it would n't make an offer unless it had georgia gulf 's consent.
in a letter to georgia gulf president jerry r. satrum mr. martin asked georgia gulf to answer its offer by tuesday.
it was n't clear how nl and mr. simmons would respond if georgia gulf spurns them again.
mr. martin said they have n't yet decided what their next move would be but he did n't rule out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed at replacing georgia gulf 's board.
in other transactions mr. simmons has followed friendly offers with a hostile tender offer.
although georgia gulf has n't been eager to negotiate with mr. simmons and nl a specialty chemicals concern the group apparently believes the company 's management is interested in some kind of transaction.
the management group owns about 18  of the stock most purchased at nominal prices and would stand to gain millions of dollars if the company were sold.
in the third quarter georgia gulf earned $ 46.1 million or $ 1.85 a share down from $ 53 million or $ 1.85 a share on fewer shares outstanding.
sales fell to $ 251.2 million from $ 278.7 million.
a licensing company representing the university of pennsylvania added johnson & johnson to its lawsuit challenging a university faculty member over rights to retin-a acne medicine.
university patents inc. based in westport conn. said it seeks johnson & johnson 's profits from sales of retin-a estimated at $ 50 million a similar amount of punitive damages and the right to license retin-a elsewhere.
in may university patents filed a suit in federal court in philadelphia against albert m. kligman a researcher and professor at the university of pennsylvania school of medicine who developed retin-a in the 1960s to combat acne.

criticism in the u.s. over recent japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries ' relations.
officials from both nations say the u.s. public 's skittishness about japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in washington.
not that washington and tokyo disagree on the japanese acquisitions ; indeed each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the u.s.
where they disagree is on the subject of u.s. direct investment in japan.
the u.s. wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment ; japan denies there are real barriers.
the heated talk stirred up by recent japanese investments in the u.s. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate even though it 's only one of many subjects to be covered in the bilateral talks known as the structural impediments initiative.
the japanese  should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy  says charles dallara u.s. assistant treasury secretary who has been in tokyo this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders.
we have a long history of maintaining an open direct-investment policy  mr. dallara says.
u.s. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment  in japan.
the japanese fret openly about the u.s. public 's rancor.
-lcb- in the u.s. -rcb- to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the american people  said the spokesman taizo watanabe.
at the same time though he chastised the media for paying such close attention to japanese investment when other foreign countries notably britain are acquiring more american assets.
fears that japanese investors are buying up america have escalated sharply in the past several weeks with sony corp. 's purchase of columbia pictures entertainment inc. from coca-cola co. and mitsubishi estate co. 's acquisition of a 51  holding in rockefeller group the owner of some of midtown manhattan 's most exclusive real estate.
even before those moves added fuel the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in japan of one u.s. investor t. boone pickens jr.
the texas oilman has acquired a 26.2  stake valued at more than $ 1.2 billion in an automotive-lighting company koito manufacturing co.
but he has failed to gain any influence at the company.
koito has refused to grant mr. pickens seats on its board asserting he is a greenmailer trying to pressure koito 's other shareholders into buying him out at a profit.
mr. pickens made considerable political hay with his troubles in japan.
the senate finance committee chaired by a fellow texan democratic sen. lloyd bentsen last month urged u.s. trade representative carla hills to use mr. pickens 's experience in talks with tokyo  to highlight this problem facing americans who seek access to the japanese capital markets.
while mr. dallara and japanese officials say the question of investors ' access to the u.s. and japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public 's attention a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week 's talks.
among them are differences in savings and investment rates corporate structures and management and government spending.
each side has a litany of recommendations for the other.
the u.s. says it is anxious for results.
we feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we 've identified and we need it by next spring  mr. dallara says.
both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed.
but they have n't clarified what those might be.
after the first set of meetings two months ago some u.s. officials complained that japan had n't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make.
the japanese retort that the first round was too early to make concessions.
just to say the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything  says a ministry of international trade and industry official.
we need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it.
that process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time the japanese say no matter how badly the u.s. wants quick results.
for instance at the first meeting the two sides could n't even agree on basic data used in price discussions.
since then a team of about 15 miti and u.s. commerce department officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices.
by monday they hope to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust.
little by little there is progress  says the miti official.
both sides are taking action.

while worry grows about big japanese investments in the u.s. japan 's big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in america 's smaller business.
for japan the controversial trend improves access to american markets and technology.
but for small american companies it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help.
take the deal with candela laser corp. a wayland mass. manufacturer of high-tech medical devices which three years ago set its sights on japan as an export market.
partly to help clear the myriad obstacles facing any overseas company trying to penetrate japan tiny candela turned to mitsui & co. one of japan 's largest trading companies for investment.
in a joint-venture deal mitsui guided candela through tokyo 's bureaucratic maze.
it eventually secured ministry of health import approval for two candela laser products one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions.
at last count candela had sold $ 4 million of its medical devices in japan.
the deal also gave mitsui access to a high-tech medical product.
they view this as a growth area so they went about it with a systematic approach  says richard olsen a candela vice president.
indeed for many japanese trading companies the favorite u.s. small business is one whose research and development can be milked for future japanese use.
the japanese companies bankroll many small u.s. companies with promising products or ideas frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks wo n't touch.
japanese companies have financed small and medium-sized u.s. firms for years but in recent months the pace has taken off.
in the first half of 1989 alone japanese corporations invested $ 214 million in minority positions in u.s. companies a 61  rise from the figure for all of 1987 reports venture economics inc.
the needham mass. concern tracks investments in new businesses.
in addition of course some of the japanese investments involved outright purchase of small u.s. firms.
heightened japanese interest in american small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving japanese companies control of large highly visible u.s. corporations such as columbia pictures entertainment inc.
only this week it was announced that mitsubishi estate co. had acquired a 51  stake in rockefeller group which owns new york 's prestigious rockefeller center.
while the small deals are far less conspicuous they add to japanese penetration of the u.s. market.
as the deals also improve japanese access to american technology and market knowledge they feed american anxieties in this area too.
even a low-tech product like plate glass can catch a trading company 's fancy if there 's a strategic fit.
free state glass industries of warrenton va. a small fabricator of architectural glass was foundering under its original management.
last year mitsubishi international corp. the new york-based arm of mitsubishi corp. bought controlling interest in the glass company in a joint venture with ronald bodner a glass industry executive and mitsubishi consultant.
the deal is chiefly designed *-3 to give mitsubishi a window on the u.s. glass industry says ichiro wakui an executive in mitsubishi 's general merchandise department in new york.
it 's not just a simple investment in a small company  mr. wakui says.
we want to see the glass market from the inside not the outside.
mitsubishi 's investment in free state is  very small  less than $ 4 million  mr. wakui says.
mr. bodner declines to comment on the arrangement.
trading companies such as mitsubishi mitsui c. itoh & co. and nissho-iwai corp. which make many of the japanese investments in small u.s. concerns have no u.s. counterpart.
these vertically integrated combines some of which got their start in japan 's feudal period deal globally in commodities construction and manufacturing.
they operate ships and banks.
all the  sogo-shosha  are looking for new business  says arthur klauser adviser to the president of mitsui u.s.a. using the japanese term for the largest of the global trading houses.
adds takeshi kondo senior vice president of c. itoh america inc. :  we have a great interest in making investments particularly in new ventures.
a host of electronics firms in california 's silicon valley were financed with trading-company venture capital.
profit at least in the short term is usually a secondary goal.
strategic objectives not financial return drive many of the deals  says a venture economics spokesman.
in investing on the basis of future transactions a role often performed by merchant banks trading companies can cut through the logjam that small-company owners often face with their local commercial banks.
it 's the classic problem of the small businessman  says malcolm davies managing director of trading alliance corp. of new york.
people are queuing at the door to take his product but he does n't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very unsympathetic.
they want assets they want a balance sheet which has no relation to the business a company can generate.
adds mitsui 's mr. klauser :  unlike corporations in this country trading companies are n't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows.
to the extent they can do this they 're quite content to get a return on investment of 1  to 2.
mr. klauser says mitsui has 75 u.s. subsidiaries in which it holds 35  interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its u.s. affiliates in 1990.
sales by these subsidiaries in the fiscal year ending last march were more than $ 17 billion.
a 1  to 2  return on $ 17 billion  ai n't hay  mr. klauser says.
hudson general corp. 's president and chief executive officer alan j. stearn resigned.
mr. stearn 46 years old could n't be reached for comment.
a company spokesman declined to elaborate on the departure.
hudson general which provides maintenance fueling and other services to airlines and airports reported a loss for its most recent fiscal year and last month omitted the semiannual dividend on its common shares.
mr. stearn who had been with the company more than 20 years and had been president since 1984 will act as a consultant to hudson general.
his duties as chief executive will be assumed by chairman jay b. langner.
for 10 years genie driskill went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient.
a high-balance customer that banks pine for she did n't give much thought to the rates she was receiving nor to the fees she was paying.
but in august first atlanta national bank introduced its crown account a package designed to lure customers such as ms. driskill.
among other things it included checking safe deposit box and credit card all for free plus a good deal on installment loans.
all she had to do was put $ 15,000 in a certificate of deposit or qualify for a $ 10,000 personal line of credit.
i deserve something for my loyalty  she says.
she took her business to first atlanta.
so it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days.
for nearly a decade banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans.
the competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services.
but many banks are turning away from strict price competition.
instead they are trying to build customer loyalty by bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population.
you 're dead in the water if you are n't segmenting the market  says anne moore president of synergistics research corp. a bank consulting firm in atlanta.
ncnb corp. of charlotte n.c. recently introduced its financial connections program aimed at young adults just starting careers.
the program not only offers a pre-approved car loan up to $ 18,000 but throws in a special cash-flow statement to help in saving money.
in september union planters corp. of memphis tenn. launched the edge account a package designed for the  thirtysomething  crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees and a full percentage point off on installment loans.
the theory : such individuals many with young children are in their prime borrowing years and having borrowed from the bank they may continue to use it for other services in later years.
for some time banks have been aiming packages at the elderly the demographic segment with the highest savings.
those efforts are being stepped up.
judie macdonald vice president of retail sales at barnett banks inc. of jacksonville fla. says the company now targets sub-segments within the market by tailoring its popular seniors partners program to various life styles.
varying age geography and life-style differences create numerous sub-markets  ms. macdonald says.
she says individual barnett branches can add different benefits to their seniors partners package such as athletic activities or travel clubs to appeal to local market interests.
an active 55-year-old in boca raton may care more about senior olympic games while a 75-year-old in panama city may care more about a seminar on health  she says.
banks have tried packaging before.
in 1973 wells fargo & co. of san francisco launched the gold account which included free checking a credit card safe-deposit box and travelers checks for a $ 3 monthly fee.
the concept begot a slew of copycats but the banks stopped promoting the packages.
one big reason : thin margins.
many banks particularly smaller ones were slow to computerize and could n't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable.
as banks ' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs.
but now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age income and geography.
they are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s.
deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits as well as opened up the field for new products such as high-rate cds.
where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account it began offering money-market accounts certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking and staggering rates based on the size of deposits.
the competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as norwest corp. of minneapolis and chemical banking corp. of new york extend their market-share battles into small towns across the nation.
today a banker is worrying about local regional and money-center -lcb- banks -rcb- as well as thrifts and credit unions  says ms. moore at synergistics research.
so people who were n't even thinking about targeting 10 years ago are scrambling to define their customer base.
the competition has cultivated a much savvier consumer.
the average household will spread 19 accounts over a dozen financial institutions  says michael p. sullivan who runs his own bank consulting firm in charlotte n.c.
this much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today 's rate-sensitive customers costly.
packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place.
for their troubles the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate.
the more accounts customers have mr. sullivan says the more likely they are to be attracted to a package and to be loyal to the bank that offers it.
that can pay off down the road as customers especially the younger ones change from borrowers to savers/investors.
packaging has some drawbacks.
the additional technology personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive.
chemical bank spent more than $ 50 million to introduce its chemplus line several packages aimed at different segments in 1986 according to thomas jacob senior vice president of marketing.
it 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive and make it pay  mr. jacob says.
still bankers expect packaging to flourish primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs.
these days banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them  ms. moore says.
some banks are already moving in that direction according to alvin t. sale marketing director at first union corp. in charlotte.
first union he says now has packages for seven customer groups.
soon it will split those into 30.
says mr. sale :  i think more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store not the boutique.
irassharedata inc. said it will amend a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission to delete a plan to sell 500,000 newly issued common shares.
the chandler arizona company said it will resubmit the registration to cover only the 2.3 million warrants each exercisable for the purchase of one common share.
currently sharedata has about 4.1 million common shares outstanding.
sharedata develops and markets low-cost software peripheral equipment and accessories for computers.
five things you can do for $ 15,000 or less :.
1.buy a new chevrolet.
2.take a hawaiian vacation.
3.send your child to a university.
4.buy a diamond necklace.
5.make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an american savings-and-loan association through the foster corporate parents plan.
americans today spend $ 15,000 like pocket change they do n't think much about it.
but for an ailing savings-and-loan association teetering on insolvency it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise.
your $ 15,000 will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent and out of the federal budget deficit.
as a foster corporate parent you 'll be helping a neighborhood s&l in areas crucial to its survival.
like healthy regulatory capital.
a steady deposit base.
performing loans.
at the same time you 'll give your foster savings institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors for good.
as a foster corporate parent you will experience the same joy felt by robert bass lewis ranieri william simon and others who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves.
that builds confidence self sufficiency not to mention critical regulatory net worth.
do n't wait a savings institution needs your help now ! every day you delay a savings institution 's health and the federal budget deficit grows worse.
think about the good you can do for just $ 15,000 a month about the cost of a mid-size chevrolet or two semesters at a state university.
then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line.
every $ 15,000 you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale and keep your foster savings institution off the federal budget deficit ! mr. baris is a lawyer in new york.
the chicago mercantile exchange said it plans to institute an additional  circuit breaker  aimed at stemming market slides.
separately john phelan told a closed house subcommittee meeting in washington that he would support securities and exchange commission halts of program trading during market emergencies.
but the new york stock exchange chairman said he does n't support reinstating a  collar  on program trading arguing that firms could get around such a limit.
the chicago merc said a new one-hour price limit would take effect in its standard & poor 's 500 stock-index futures pit once s&p 500 futures fell 20 index points the equivalent of about a 150-point drop in the dow jones industrial average.
if the 20-point limit is triggered after 1:30 p.mchicago time it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at 3:15 p.m.
with the limit in effect members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices but not below it.
the exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index futures on friday oct. 13 when the dow jones industrials plunged 190 points and stock-index futures prices skidded as well.
late that afternoon the s&p 500 stock-index futures contract fell a total of 30 index points hitting a merc circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session.
the merc said that its existing 30-minute 12-point limit on s&p 500 stock-index futures trading equal to about 100 points on the dow jones industrials which was triggered oct. 13 will remain in effect.
leo melamed merc executive committee chairman said that the 12-point limit appeared to lessen the selling panic oct. 13.
but when the contract reopened the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the 30-point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices synchronized.
several traders maintained that the merc 's 12-point circuit-breaker aggravated the market slide oct. 13 by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the new york stock exchange.
all of the changes require regulatory approval which is expected shortly.
the exchange also said that the 30-point circuit breaker which currently provides only a one-hour respite during market sell-offs will become the maximum one-day limit for the s&p 500 stock-index futures contract ; the one-day limit now is 50 index points.
a final modification was made to the five-point opening limit for the contract.
the merc said that five-point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading.
the limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening 10 minutes of trading.
in washington house aides said mr. phelan told congressmen that the collar which banned program trades through the big board 's computer when the dow jones industrial average moved 50 points did n't work well.
he said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades manually.
in a post-hearing news conference mr. phelan who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility said he told the house finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program-trading halt proposal  providing the sec would be comfortable with the language  in a bill.
the program-trading issue is heating up on capitol hill as it is on wall street and several legislators want to grant the sec the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile.
sec chairman richard breeden has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs.
a house aide suggested that mr. phelan was so  vague and mushy  that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could  come out *-2 feeling good.
at one point mr. phelan angered the subcommittee 's chairman rep. edward markey d. mass. by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers.
markey said we could have done this in public  because so little sensitive information was disclosed the aide said.
mr. phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel the aide added.
at another point during the hearing rep. markey asked mr. phelan what would be discussed at a new york exchange board meeting today.
mr. phelan said the big board is likely to study the program-trading issue.
that response annoyed rep. markey house aides said and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter.
fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing most notably rep. john dingell d. mich. the full house energy and commerce committee chairman who has been willing to let mr. markey carry the legislation in recent months.
mr. dingell expressed concern sources said about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading which uses futures to offset stock trades.
the futures industry is regulated by the commodity futures trading commission which reports to the agriculture committees in both houses.
the art of change-ringing is peculiar to the english and like most english peculiarities unintelligible to the rest of the world.
dorothy l. sayers  the nine tailors  aslacton england of all scenes that evoke rural england this is one of the loveliest : an ancient stone church stands amid the fields the sound of bells cascading from its tower calling the faithful to evensong.
the parishioners of st. michael and all angels stop to chat at the church door as members here always have.
in the tower five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614.
but there is also a discordant modern note in aslacton though it ca n't be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening.
like most of the other 6,000 churches in britain with sets of bells st. michael once had its own  band  of ringers who would herald every sunday morning and evening service.
now only one local ringer remains : 64-year-old derek hammond.
the others here today live elsewhere.
they belong to a group of 15 ringers including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training who drive every sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of east anglia.
*-1 to ring for even one service at this tower we have to scrape  says mr. hammond a retired water-authority worker.
we 've tried to train the youngsters but they have their discos and their dances and they just drift away.
mr. hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the east anglian group that keeps the aslacton bells pealing.
history after all is not on his side.
according to a nationwide survey taken a year ago nearly a third of england 's church bells are no longer rung on sundays because there is no one to ring them.
it is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes.
the less complicated version of playing tunes on bells as do the carillons of continental europe is considered by the english to be childish fit only for foreigners.
change-ringing a mind-boggling exercise the english invented 380 years ago requires physical dexterity some bells weigh more than a ton combined with intense mental concentration.
proper english bells are started off in  rounds  from the highest-pitched bell to the lowest a simple descending scale using in larger churches as many as 12 bells.
then at a signal the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking.
each variation or change can occur only once the rules state.
ringers memorize patterns of changes known as  methods  which have odd-sounding names like kent treble bob major or grandsire caters.
a series of 5,000 or so changes is a  peal  and takes about three hours.
a look at a thursday night practice at st. mary abbot church in the kensington district of london gives an idea of the work involved.
ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter 's stance each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber.
no one speaks and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves muffled by the ceiling.
totally absorbed the ringers stare straight ahead using peripheral vision they call it  rope-sight  to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls.
far above in the belfry the huge bronze bells mounted on wheels swing madly through a full 360 degrees starting and ending surprisingly in the inverted or mouth-up position.
skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change.
in a well-known detective-story involving church bells english novelist dorothy l. sayers described ringing as a  passion -lcb- that -rcb- finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection.
ringers she added are  filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed.
ringing does become a bit of an obsession  admits stephanie pattenden master of the band at st. mary abbot and one of england 's best female ringers.
it is a passion that usually stays in the tower however.
more often than not ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry.
when their changes are completed *t*-1 and after they have worked up a sweat ringers often skip off to the local pub leaving worship for others below.
this does not sit well with some clerics.
with membership of the church of england steadily dwindling strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services.
two years ago the rev. jeremy hummerstone vicar of great torrington devon got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he sacked the entire band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest.
they were a self-perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises  the vicar hummerstone says.
an entirely new band rings today at great torrington several of whom are members of the congregation.
but there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells.
at st. mary 's church in ilminster somerset the bells have fallen silent following a dust-up over church attendance.
the vicar w.d. jones refuses to talk about it saying it would  reopen the wound.
but c.j.b. marshall vicar of a nearby church feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar.
so crunch crunch crunch bang bang bang here come the ringers from above making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer  he says.
vicar marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself.
the sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church  he says.
i live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life.
the central council of church bell ringers a sort of parliament of ringing groups aims to improve relations with vicars says john c. baldwin president.
it hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled  the bells in your care.
says mr. baldwin  we recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience.
mr. baldwin is also attacking the greater problem : lack of ringers.
one survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in england today only 40,000 of them still ring.
also ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be rung *-140 like in small rural parishes and inner-city churches.
but the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful says mr. baldwin.
right now we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10  he adds.
one bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field ; more than a third of the ringers today are women.
they are n't accepted everywhere however.
the oldest bell-ringing group in the country the ancient society of college youths founded in 1637 remains male-only a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for britain 's most prestigious churches st. paul 's cathedral and westminster abbey.
this being britain no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to  the ringing world  a weekly newspaper for ringers.
one writer signing his letter as  red-blooded balanced male  remarked on the  frequency of women fainting in peals  and suggested that they  settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings.
in the torrent of replies that followed one woman ringer from solihull observed that  the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired *-141 : badly dressed decorated with acne and a large beer-belly frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals.
another women wrote from sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing  i have never known a lady to faint in the belfry.
i have seen one or two men die bless them.
investors unsettled by the stock market 's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks.
that has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than 10.
but do n't breathe too easy : those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices some analysts warn.
in the past they say the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over.
that can be a trap for unwary investors says richard bernstein senior quantitative analyst at merrill lynch & co.
strong dividend growth he says is  the black widow of valuation  a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating.
stephen boesel president of t. rowe price growth and income fund explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time.
invariably those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments  he says.
and recessionary environments are n't hospitable to the stock market.
indeed analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks.
in 1976 for example dividends on the stocks in standard & poor 's 500-stock index soared 10  following much slower growth the year before.
the s&p index started sliding in price in september 1976 and fell 12  in 1977 despite a 15  expansion in dividends that year.
that pattern has n't always held but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious.
payouts on the s&p 500 stocks rose 10  in 1988 according to standard & poor 's corp. and wall street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9  and 14.
many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year although a minority see double-digit gains continuing.
meanwhile many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag : while dividends have risen smartly their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices.
as a result the market 's dividend yield dividends as a percentage of price has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards.
put another way the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay some market analysts say.
they are keeping a close watch on the yield on the s&p 500.
the figure is currently about 3.3  up from 3.2  before the recent market slide.
some analysts say investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3.
a drop below that 3  benchmark  has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued  says mr. boesel of t. rowe price.
in fact  the market has always tanked.
there 's never been an exception  says gerald w. perritt a chicago investment adviser and money manager based on a review of six decades of stock-market data.
the last time the s&p 500 yield dropped below 3  was in the summer of 1987.
stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the october debacle.
there have been only seven other times in 1929 1933 1961 1965 1968 1971 and 1972 when the yield on the s&p 500 dropped below 3  for at least two consecutive months mr. perritt found.
and in each case he says a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year.
still some market analysts say the current 3.3  reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past.
it 's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner  says james h. coxon head of stock investments for cigna corp. the philadelphia-based insurer.
in particular mr. coxon says businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically.
so while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength.
rather than increasing dividends some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares notes steven g. einhorn co-chairman of the investment policy committee at goldman sachs & co.
he factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6.
that is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so he says.
what will happen to dividend growth next year ?
common wisdom suggests a single-digit rate of growth reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits.
painewebber inc. for instance is forecasting growth in s&p 500 dividends of just under 5  in 1990 down from an estimated 11  this year.
in other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns the environment the firm expects in 1990 the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4  to a decline of 1  according to painewebber analyst thomas doerflinger.
the minority argument meanwhile is that businesses have the financial wherewithal this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken.
dividend growth on the order of 12  is expected by both mr. coxon of cigna and mr. einhorn of goldman sachs.
those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures.
one indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from standard & poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends.
a total of 139 companies raised dividends in october basically unchanged from 138 a year ago s&p said wednesday.
that followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace.
while the s&p tally does n't measure the magnitude of dividend changes a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year.
in any case opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels.
mr. einhorn of goldman sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a 12  to 15  total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months vs. a  cash rate of return  of perhaps 7  or 8  if dividend growth is weak.
but mr. boesel of t. rowe price who also expects 12  growth in dividends next year does n't think it will help the overall market all that much.
having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook but i do n't think it 's a main consideration  he says.
with slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year  i would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels.
your oct. 13 page-one story on the renewed plight of western union says that western union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down alexander graham bell 's offer to it of his invention because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph.
such is hardly the case.
bell 's father-in-law gardner g. hubbard wealthy and well-connected obtained financing to start the american bell telephone co. in boston which even had a subsidiary in new york called the telephone co. of new york.
this is where bell 's patents went.
western union indeed wanted to get into the telephone business.
it acquired thomas edison 's microphone patent and then immediately sued the bell co. claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather emile berliner which had been sold to bell for a princely $ 50,000 infringed upon western union 's edison patent.
when bell established that the berliner patent caveat was registered 10 days before edison 's application western union dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business the basis for the company 's current plight.

troubled nbi inc. said it fired more than half its work force and is discontinuing its hardware business *-1 to focus on its software and service operations.
the ailing company which has reported net losses for 16 consecutive quarters said it wo n't manufacture network computer systems any more and will greatly reduce its costly direct sales force.
altogether nbi said it will eliminate 266 jobs at its boulder headquarters 176 field sales jobs and 50 jobs at its canadian and united kingdom headquarters.
the company 's work force will fall to about 400 people.
stephen g. jerritts president and chief executive officer said customers were n't willing to commit to an expensive nbi hardware systems because of the company 's financial troubles.
further he said the company does n't have the capital needed to build the business over the next year or two.
we flat ran out of financing resources  mr. jerritts said.
we had to do something structurally and radically different.
as a result he said nbi will focus on servicing its installed base of systems trying to provide maintenance for other manufacturers and expanding its software business using some of the applications it developed for its hardware.
the company currently offers a word-processing package for personal computers called legend.
the company which recently said it lacked the profits and capital to pay dividends on its series a convertible preferred stock said it has hired an investment banker to help it raise additional cash.
in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday nbi common closed at 93 cents a share up 31 cents.
it was richard nixon 's first visit to china in 1972 that set in motion the historic rapprochement between beijing and washington.
but the former u.s. president 's sixth visit to china during which he spoke at length with chinese leaders was nowhere near as successful at easing strains that have recently afflicted the sino-u.s. relationship.
mr. nixon the most prominent american 0 to come to china since beijing 's bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in june harped on international outrage over the massacre.
the chinese in turn took aim at american  interference  in china 's domestic affairs.
one official newspaper legal daily even directly criticized mr. nixon who is normally referred to here as an  old friend.
the paper accused him of being a leading proponent of  peaceful evolution  a catch phrase to describe what china believes is the policy of western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere.
the tension was evident on wednesday evening during mr. nixon 's final banquet toast normally an opportunity for reciting platitudes about eternal friendship.
instead mr. nixon reminded his host chinese president yang shangkun that americans have n't forgiven china 's leaders for the military assault of june 3-4 that killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of demonstrators.
many in the united states including many friends of china believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified  mr. nixon told mr. yang who was directly involved in ordering the attack.
the events of april through june damaged the respect and confidence which most americans previously had for the leaders of china.
the chinese responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion.
in talks with mr. nixon chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings and even suggested that the u.s. was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring.
in a meeting tuesday supreme leader deng xiaoping told mr. nixon  frankly speaking the u.s. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in beijing not long ago.
china was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove china for it.
despite the harsh exchanges the u.s. and china still seem to be looking for a way to mend relations which have deteriorated into what mr. nixon referred to as  the greatest crisis in chinese-american relations  since his initial visit to china 17 years ago.
in his return toast to mr. nixon mr. yang said the relationship had reached a  stalemate.
relations between china and the u.s. have been tense since june 7 when chinese dissident fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian took refuge in the u.s. embassy in beijing.
shortly afterwards mr. bush imposed a series of anti-china sanctions including suspension of most high-level talks which could be codified in u.s. congressional legislation in the coming weeks.
mr. nixon is traveling in china as a private citizen but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the bush administration.
mr. nixon met mr. bush and his national security adviser brent scowcroft before coming to china on saturday.
and he plans to brief the president at the end of the week u.s. sources said.
mr. nixon was to leave china today.
according to an american member of the nixon party the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his 20 hours of talks with top-level chinese officials.
these included china 's economic policies human rights and the question of mr. fang.
mr. nixon also proposed that china restore its participation in the fulbright program a u.s. government-funded academic exchange.
china pulled out of the program in july.
in his talks the former president urged china 's leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas.
ideas are going over borders and there 's no sdi ideological weapon that can shoot them down  he told a group of americans at the u.s. embassy on wednesday.
there are no signs however of china 's yielding on key issues.
but in one minor matter mr. nixon appears to have gained a concession.
in a meeting with premier li peng on monday mr. nixon said that he hoped he would n't encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the u.s. embassy.
sure enough when he arrived at the embassy two days later the machine-gun-toting guards were gone for the first time in five months.
a few blocks away at the u.s. ambassador 's residence the guards encircling the compound also had discarded their uzi-model arms for the first time since early june.
but the guards there retained their pistols and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars.
moreover police and soldiers continue to harass americans who have filed several protests with the foreign ministry in the past week.
several times chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of u.s. diplomats and clicked the trigger.
the rifles were n't loaded.
your oct. 6 article  japan 's financial firms lure science graduates  states  industrial companies are accusing financial institutions of jeopardizing japan 's economy by raising the salary stakes for new employees.
the japanese industrial companies should know better.
they are barking up the wrong tree because it is basically their fault they ca n't attract new employees.
takuma yamamoto president of fujitsu ltd. believes  the  money worship ' among young people  caused the problem.
he is just passing the buck to young people.
what 's wrong with asking for more money ?
money is not everything but it is necessary and business is not volunteer work.
it is not unethical to choose a higher-salaried job.
unfortunately japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages.
i get the impression that some japanese managers believe working harder for less money is beautiful.
i visited a lot of major japanese manufacturers but i never felt i would want to be employed by any of them.
many of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising to improve their images but they should realize that the most important thing is real change not changing people 's perceptions.
if the japanese companies are seriously considering their survival they could do at least three things to improve the situation : raise salaries higher than those of financial institutions ; improve working conditions better offices and more vacations for example ; accept and hire more labor from outside japan.
hiroshi asadain reference to your oct. 9 page-one article  barbara bush earns even higher ratings than the president  it is regrettable that you must continually define blacks by our negatives :  among liberals 60  have positive views of her while 50  approve of the president 's job performance.
in part this may reflect the fact that  she speaks a more progressive language ' than her husband as columbia 's profethel klein puts it.
among professionals 76  have a favorable opinion of her compared to 62  who approve of her husband 's performance.
while a quarter of black voters disapprove of mr. bush 's handling of his job only 15  have a negative view of his spouse.
the statistics imply that three-quarters of blacks approve of mr. bush 's job performance and 85  of blacks approve of mrs. bush.
if the assumption is that it is surprising that so few blacks find mr. and mrs. bush distasteful the positive view is even more newsworthy.
such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious stereotyped perspective.
why are we blacks continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator.

program traders are fond of predicting that if they are blocked in the u.s. they will simply emigrate to foreign stock markets.
but in london and tokyo where computer-driven trading now plays a small but growing role traders say a number of hurdles loom.
government officials especially in japan probably would resist any onslaught of program trading by players trying to shrug off the u.s. furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business.
japan is  very concerned  about the possible effects of program trading a senior japanese official said after the oct. 13 stock plunge in new york.
u.s. stock-index futures are n't even traded in japan now.
and because of the time difference the japanese and the u.s. markets ' trading hours do n't overlap.
it all adds up to a barrier to american-style index arbitrage the most popular form of u.s. program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in new york and the price of a futures contract in chicago based on those stocks.
about 11.6  of all program trading by new york stock exchange firms in september took place in foreign markets according to big board data.
yet it is difficult to imagine japan racing to introduce chicago-style stock-index futures.
japan 's finance ministry already is scrutinizing institutional investors ' activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading said makato utsumi vice minister for international finance.
program trading has taken off in japan since last year 's introduction of home-market stock-index futures trading on the tokyo and osaka stock exchanges.
but regulators are wary.
they have n't forgotten the leap in share prices last dec. 7 when the first bout of foreign-led index arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the last half-hour of trading startling regulators who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing.
japan 's finance ministry had set up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time.
maybe it was n't enough  a finance ministry official noted after the dec. 7 surge.
japan 's regulators have since tightened controls on index-related stock purchases.
tokyo 's leading program traders are the big u.s. securities houses though the japanese are playing catch-up.
some u.s. firms notably salomon inc. and morgan stanley group inc. have reaped a hefty chunk of their japanese earnings from index arbitrage both for customers and for their own accounts.
morgan stanley last week joined a growing list of u.s. securities firms that have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts.
both deryck c. maughan who heads salomon in tokyo and john s. wadsworth who heads morgan stanley there ascribe a good part of their firms ' success in tokyo to their ability to offer sophisticated futures-related investment strategies to big institutional clients.
they do n't have plans to cut back.
it has not been disruptive in the markets here  mr. maughan said.
the real difference seems to be that the cash market here  is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market is n't having the same impact it does in america.
the british also are scrutinizing program trades.
index-arbitrage trading is  something we want to watch closely  an official at london 's stock exchange said.
we do n't think there is cause for concern at the moment.
london serves increasingly as a conduit for program trading of u.s. stocks.
market professionals said london has several attractions.
first the trading is done over the counter and is n't reported on either the u.s. or london stock trading tapes.
second it can be used to unwind positions before u.s. trading begins but at prices pegged to the previous session 's big board close.
in addition to the extra privacy of these trades the transactions can often be less expensive to execute because the parties do n't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist 's fee.
still  much less -lcb- index-arbitrage activity -rcb- is done over here than in the u.s.  said richard barfield chief investment manager at standard life assurance co. which manages about # 15 billion $ 23.72 billion in united kingdom institutional funds.
britain has two main index-arbitrage instruments.
a financial times-stock exchange 100-share index option contract is traded on the london stock exchange 's traded options market.
and an ft-se futures contract is traded on the london international financial futures exchange.
both contracts have gained a following since the 1987 global market crash.
the average number of ft-se option contracts traded on the london exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract 's launch in 1984.
this year the average of daily contracts traded totaled 9,118 up from 4,645 a year earlier and from 917 in 1984.
but a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of index-options trading was only 15  of the size of the underlying equity market exchange officials said.
this compares with estimates that the u.s.  derivatives  market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market.
the house voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981 casting a solid 382-37 vote for a compromise measure backed by president bush.
the vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor.
advocates said the 90-cent-an-hour rise to $ 4.25 an hour by april 1991 is too small for the working poor while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs.
but the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on tuesday by president bush and democratic leaders in congress after congressional republicans urged the white house to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise.
so both sides accepted the compromise which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in 1977 raising the wage to $ 3.35 an hour from $ 2.65.
under the measure passed yesterday the minimum wage would rise to $ 3.80 next april.
the senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it.
there are no smiles about this bill  rep. pat williams d. mont said during house floor debate yesterday.
but  because it 's all we 've got i 'm going to vote for it.
while the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average u.s. manufacturing wage the level of $ 4.25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35  of average factory pay mr. williams said.
but rep. marge roukema r. n.j instead praised the house 's acceptance of a new youth  training  wage a subminimum that gop administrations have sought for many years.
adopting a training-wage policy means  getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage  mrs. roukema said.
policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage but they have lately touted it as necessary *-2 to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force.
labor unions and democrats long fought the idea but recently acceded to it in the face of bush administration insistence.
the compromise sets the training wage at $ 3.35 an hour next april and at $ 3.61 an hour or 85  of the minimum wage in april 1991.
employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days without restriction to workers with less than six months of job experience and for another 90 days if the company uses a government-certified training program for the young workers.
the training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old.
the white house previously insisted on an unrestricted six-month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job.
the u.s. chamber of commerce still opposed to any mininum-wage increase said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27  in two stages between april 1990 and april 1991  will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for american workers and higher prices for american consumers.
zenith data systems corp. a subsidiary of zenith electronics corp. received a $ 534 million navy contract for software and services of microcomputers over an 84-month period.
rockwell international corp. won a $ 130.7 million air force contract for ac-130u gunship replacement aircraft.

for six years t. marshall hahn jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the george bush mode : kind and gentle.
the question now : can he act more like hard-charging teddy roosevelt ?
mr. hahn the 62-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of georgia-pacific corp. is leading the forest-product concern 's unsolicited $ 3.19 billion bid for great northern nekoosa corp.
nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder a reaction mr. hahn has n't faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions all of which were negotiated behind the scenes.
so far mr. hahn is trying to entice nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough.
we are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction  he says.
but a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war with all that implies.
if a competitor enters the game for example mr. hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival.
given that choice associates of mr. hahn and industry observers say the former university president who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything would fold.
there 's a price above which i 'm positive marshall has the courage not to pay  says a.d. correll georgia-pacific 's executive vice president for pulp and paper.
says long-time associate jerry griffin vice president corporate development at wtd industries inc. :  he is n't of the old school of winning at any cost.
he also is a consensus manager insiders say.
the decision to make the bid for nekoosa for example was made only after all six members of georgia-pacific 's management committee signed onto the deal even though mr. hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on says mr. correll.
associates say mr. hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of virginia polytechnic institute.
assuming that post at the age of 35 he managed by consensus as is the rule in universities says warren h. strother a university official who is researching a book on mr. hahn.
but he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand.
in 1970 mr. hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building.
that impressed robert b. pamplin georgia-pacific 's chief executive at the time whom mr. hahn had met while fundraising for the institute.
in 1975 mr. pamplin enticed mr. hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals ; the move befuddled many in georgia-pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world.
but mr. hahn rose swiftly through the ranks demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on.
the son of a physicist mr. hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates.
moving rapidly through school he graduated phi beta kappa from the university of kentucky at age 18 after spending only 2 1/2 years in college.
he earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the massachusetts institute of technology.
mr. hahn agrees that he has a  retentive  memory but friends say that 's an understatement.
they call it  photographic.
mr. hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of georgia-pacific.
taking over as chief executive officer in 1983 he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession-inspired slide in its building-products business.
mr. hahn began selling non-core businesses such as oil and gas and chemicals.
he even sold one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers.
at the same time he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling rather than materials for new-home construction.
the idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new-home construction.
the formula has paid off so far.
georgia-pacific 's sales climbed to $ 9.5 billion last year compared with $ 6 billion in 1983 when mr. hahn took the reins.
profit from continuing operations has soared to $ 467 million from $ 75 million.
mr. hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best.
the record of companies that have diversified is n't all that impressive  he says.
nekoosa would n't be a diversification.
it would be a good match mr. hahn and many analysts say of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows.
the resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $ 13 billion.
but can mr. hahn carry it off ?
in this instance industry observers say he is entering uncharted waters.
says kathryn mcauley an analyst at first manhattan co. :  this is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced.
a house-senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $ 500 million in economic aid for poland that relies heavily on $ 240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment.
for the agency for international development appropriators approved $ 200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program and total loan guarantees for the overseas private investment corp. are increased by $ 40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same poland package.
the conference approved at least $ 55 million in direct cash and development assistance as well and though no decision was made both sides are committed to adding more than $ 200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the bush administration.
the agreement on poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill which has already provoked veto threats by the white house and is sharply confined under this year 's budget.
these fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the poland package and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on u.s. aid to eastern europe.
to accommodate the additional cash assistance the house appropriations committee last week was required to reallocate an estimated $ 140 million from the pentagon.
and though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant recent experience with a similar program in central america indicates that it could take several years before the new polish government can fully use the aid effectively.
the action on poland came as the conference separately approved $ 220 million for international population planning activities an 11  increase over fiscal 1989.
the house and senate are divided over whether the united nations population fund will receive any portion of these appropriations but the size of the increase is itself significant.
in a second area of common concern the world environment an additional $ 15 million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives related both to global warming and the plight of the african elephant.
the sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments running from an import exemption for a california airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of panama 's quota of exports to the profitable u.s. market.
panama was stripped of this right because of u.s. differences with the noriega regime but the central american country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending sept. 30 1990.
about a quarter of this share has already been reallocated according to the industry but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current u.s. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate.
the potential sales are nearly $ 9.3 million and house majority whip william gray d. pa began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to english-speaking countries of the caribbean such as jamaica and barbados.
rep. jerry lewis a conservative californian added a provision of his own intended to assist bolivia and the senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the u.s. caribbean basin initiate as well as the philippines - backed by the powerful hawaii democrat sen. daniel inouye.
jamaica wary of upsetting its caribbean basin allies has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by mr. gray but the greater question is whether mr. inouye who has strong ties to the sugar industry is able to insert a claim by the philippines.
in separate floor action the house waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $ 3.18 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal 1990.
the funding is attached to an estimated $ 27.1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all u.s. domestic airline flights.
the leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the white house but in recent days the senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the house.
the most recent example was a nearly $ 17.3 billion fiscal 1990 bill funding the state justice and commerce departments.
and after losing a battle tuesday night with the senate foreign relations committee appropriators from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference.
beauty takes backseat to safety on bridges everyone agrees that most of the nation 's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced.
but there 's disagreement over how to do it.
highway officials insist the ornamental railings on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through.
but other people do n't want to lose the bridges ' beautiful sometimes historic features.
the primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view  says jack white a planner with the indiana highway department.
he and others prefer to install railings such as the  type f safety shape  a four-foot-high concrete slab with no openings.
in richmond ind. the type f railing is being used to replace arched openings on the g street bridge.
garret boone who teaches art at earlham college calls the new structure  just an ugly bridge  and one that blocks the view of a new park below.
in hartford conn. the charter oak bridge will soon be replaced the cast-iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park.
compromises are possible.
citizens in peninsula ohio upset over changes to a bridge negotiated a deal : the bottom half of the railing will be type f while the top half will have the old bridge 's floral pattern.
similarly highway engineers agreed to keep the old railings on the key bridge in washington d.c. as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road.
tray bon ?
drink carrier competes with cartons porting potables just got easier or so claims scypher corp. the maker of the cup-tote.
the chicago company 's beverage carrier meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast-food outlets resembles the plastic loops used on six-packs of beer only the loops hang from a web of strings.
the new carrier can tote as many as four cups at once.
inventor claire marvin says his design virtually eliminates spilling.
lids are n't even needed.
he also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers.
a few fast-food outlets are giving it a try.
the company acknowledges some problems.
a driver has to find something to hang the carrier on so the company supplies a window hook.
while it breaks down in prolonged sunlight it is n't recyclable.
and unlike some trays there 's no place for food.
spirit of perestroika touches design world an exchange of u.s. and soviet designers promises change on both sides.
an exhibition of american design and architecture opened in september in moscow and will travel to eight other soviet cities.
the show runs the gamut from a blender to chairs to a model of the citicorp building.
the event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at carnegie-mellon and leningrad 's mutchin institute.
dan droz leader of the carnegie-mellon group sees benefits all around.
the soviets who normally have few clients other than the state will get  exposure to a market system  he says.
americans will learn more about making products for the soviets.
mr. droz says the soviets could even help u.s. designers renew their sense of purpose.
in moscow they kept asking us things like  why do you make 15 different corkscrews when all you need is one good one ? '  he says.
they got us thinking maybe we should be helping u.s. companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones.
seed for jail solution fails to take root it 's a two birds with one stone deal : eggers group architects propose using grain elevators to house prisoners.
it would ease jail overcrowding while preserving historic structures the company says.
but new york state which is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage says  no.
grain elevators built in the 1920s and '30s have six-inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle the new york firm says.
many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster yet close enough to permit family visits.
besides eggers says grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of egypt.
a number of cities including minneapolis philadelphia and houston have vacant grain elevators eggers says.
a medium-sized one in brooklyn it says could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate new york.
a spokesman for the state however calls the idea  not effective or cost efficient.
the labor department cited usx corp. for numerous health and safety violations at two pennsylvania plants and proposed $ 7.3 million in fines the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer.
the department 's occupational safety and health administration proposed fines of $ 6.1 million for alleged violations at the company 's fairless hills pa. steel mill ; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility.
osha cited nearly 1,500 alleged violations of federal electrical crane-safety record-keeping and other requirements.
a second citation covering the company 's clairton pa. coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical-safety and other requirements for which osha proposed $ 1.2 million in fines.
labor secretary elizabeth dole said  the magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards.
osha said there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972.
gerard scannell the head of osha said usx managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years  yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards.
particularly flagrant  mrs. dole said  are the company 's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its fairless works in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier corporate-wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies.
that settlement was in april 1987.
a usx spokesman said the company had n't yet received any documents from osha regarding the penalty or fine.
once we do they will receive very serious evaluation  the spokesman said.
no consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees.
usx said it has been cooperating with osha since the agency began investigating the clairton and fairless works.
he said that if and when safety problems were identified they were corrected.
the usx citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by osha under mr. scannell.
he has promised stiffer fines though the size of penalties sought by osha have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year.
the big problem is that usx management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to * safeguarding safety and health in the plants  said linda anku osha regional administrator in philadelphia.
usx has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent occupational safety and health review commission.
before the usx case osha 's largest proposed fine for one employer was $ 4.3 million for alleged safety violations at john morrell & co. a meatpacking subsidiary of united brands co. cincinnati.
the company is contesting the fine.
due to an editing error a letter to the editor in yesterday 's edition from frederick h. hallett mistakenly identified the nrdc.
it should be the natural resources defense council.
your oct. 6 editorial  the ill homeless  referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the sept. 8 issue of the journal of the american medical association.
your comments implied we had discovered that the  principal cause  of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population.
we have made no such statement.
it is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless.
the  causes  of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case.
in quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism.
you did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse.
they suffered from malnutrition chest diseases cardiovascular disorders skin problems infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape.
homeless people not only lack safety privacy and shelter they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition cleanliness and basic health care.
in a recent report the institute of medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness others may be a consequence of it and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter.
the interactions between health and homelessness are complex defying sweeping generalizations as to  cause  or  effect.
if we look to the future preventing homelessness is an important objective.
this will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research.
william r. breakey m.d. pamela j. fischer m.d. department of psychiatry johns hopkins university school of medicine baltimore a study by tulane prof. james wright says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems with the common thread of poverty.
the study shows that nearly 40  of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25  of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug alcohol and mental problems.
according to dr. wright homelessness is  simultaneously a housing problem an employment problem a demographic problem a problem of social disaffiliation a mental health problem a family violence problem a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level.
leighton e. cluff m.d. president robert wood johnson foundation princeton n.j.
to quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded drop-in center for the homeless in new york :  if you 're homeless you do n't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered.
after your first three weeks of sleep deprivation you 're scarcely in touch with reality any more ; without psychiatric treatment you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again.
some of the homeless obviously had pre-existing mental illness or addiction.
but many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim brutal world of our city streets.
once there what ways of escape are open to them other than drink drugs or insanity ?
maxwell r.d. vos brooklyn n.y.
you dismiss as  sentimental  the view that the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs by 77  might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the reagan-bush years.
there is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic : namely that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness.
your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made.
robert s. jenkins cambridge mass.
of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in washington for the homeless you chose to cite such groups as the national association of home builders and the international union of bricklayers and allied craftsmen insinuating that the march got its major support from self-serving groups that  know a good thing when they see it  and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive.
but is n't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to and advertise in your paper ?
why did n't you mention the ymca or the ywca or catholic charities usa or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march ?
as for the findings on the 203 baltimore homeless who underwent psychiatric examinations i suggest you conduct your own survey.
choose 203 business executives including perhaps someone from your own staff and put them out on the streets to be deprived for one month of their homes families and income.
i would predict that within a short time most of them would find thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for chivas regal and that their  normal  phobias anxieties depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically.

rogers communications inc. said it plans to raise 175 million to 180 million canadian dollars us$ 148.9 million to $ 153.3 million through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares.
perpetual preferred shares are n't retractable by the holders the company said.
rogers said the shares will be convertible into class b shares but that the company has the option to redeem the shares before a conversion takes place.
a spokesman for the toronto cable television and telecommunications concern said the coupon rate has n't yet been fixed but will probably be set at around 8.
he declined to discuss other terms of the issue.
the house passed legislation designed to make it easier for the transportation department to block airline leveraged buy-outs.
the final vote came after the house rejected republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor.
the bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry but the 300-113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential 0 to override a veto.
the broader question is where the senate stands on the issue.
while the senate commerce committee has approved legislation similar to the house bill on airline leveraged buy-outs the measure has n't yet come to the full floor.
although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline it is aimed at giving the transportation department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt.
the purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier 's ability to compete  rep. john paul hammerschmidt r. ark said.
the bill as it was approved by the house public works and transportation committee would give the transportation department up to 50 days * to review any purchase of 15  or more of the stock in an airline.
the department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired ; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished ; it would be put into foreign control ; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit.
the house approved an amendment offered by rep. peter defazio d. ore. that would in addition to the previous criteria also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees or their wages or benefits.
rep. james traficant d. ohio said the amendment which passed 271-147 would  let the american worker know that we consider them occasionally.
but rep. hammerschmidt said that the provision which he dubbed a  special interest  amendment was likely to make the bill even more controversial.
on thursday the house approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the transportation department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
the provision called the  two-time-losers  amendment by its supporters apparently was aimed at preventing texas air corp. chairman frank lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline.
follow-up report : you now may drop by the voice of america offices in washington and read the text of what the voice is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week.
you can even take notes extensive notes for the voice folks wo n't look over your shoulder about what you read.
you can do all this even if you 're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of congress.
and my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts.
until the other day you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world.
that was the law.
and i apparently had no right to print hither what the voice was booming to yon.
it was censorship.
it was outrageous.
and it was stupid.
the theory was that the voice is a propaganda agency and this government should n't propagandize its own people.
that sounds neat but this government any government propagandizes its own people every day.
government press releases speeches briefings tours of military facilities publications are all propaganda of sorts.
propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue.
the restrictions on viewing and dissemination of voice material were especially absurd : an agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform.
in june 1988 i wrote in this space about this issue.
assuming it was n't one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door i 'll review the facts.
the voice of america is a government agency that broadcasts news and views some might say propaganda in 43 languages to 130 million listeners around the world.
it does a first-rate job.
its budget $ 184 million is paid for by you.
but a 1948 law barred the  dissemination  of that material in the u.s.
the law let scholars reporters and researchers read texts of voa material only at voa headquarters in washington but it barred them from copying texts.
and of course there 's that word  dissemination.
how 's that again ?
you may come by the agency to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying  a voice official explained when i asked.
what if i tune in my short-wave radio transcribe an editorial or program and print it in my newspaper ?
nor are you free to reprint such material  i was advised.
that sounded a lot like censorship so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere i sued.
a couple of weeks ago i lost the case in federal district court in des moines.
at least that 's the way it was reported.
and indeed the lawsuit was dismissed.
but i i like to think of it in terms of we all of us won the point.
for a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling : the united states information agency which runs the voice changed its position on three key points.
the usia said that on reflection of course i could print anything i could get my hands on.
the word dissemination it decided referred only to itself.
the usia officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the usia to disseminate agency program materials in the united states  my lawyer the scholarly mark mccormick of des moines said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that i had lost.
the court noted the new usia position but just in case officially found  that congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating usia information domestically.
the usia said that on reflection anyone could view the voa materials not just the reporters scholars researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute.
the usia publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials notwithstanding the statutory designations because the usia has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials  mr. mccormick noted.
and the usia said that all of us could take extensive notes.
the agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken  mr. mccormick reported.
i had sought in my suit the right to print voice material which had been denied me and i had sought a right to receive the information arguing in effect that a right to print government information is n't very helpful if i have no right to get the information.
but the court disagreed.
the first amendment proscribes the government from passing laws abridging the right to free speech  judge donald o'brien ruled.
the first amendment does not prescribe a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press.
so now the situation is this : you have a right to read voice of america scripts if you do n't mind traveling to washington every week or so and visiting the voice office during business hours.
i have a right to print those scripts if i go there and laboriously but no longer surreptitiously copy them out in long hand.
but neither of us can copy the material on a xerox machine or have it sent to us.
in an era when every government agency has a public-relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not this does seem odd.
indeed judge o'brien ruled that  it would be easy to conclude that the usia 's position is  inappropriate or even stupid '  but it 's the law.
so the next step i suspect is to try to get the law changed.
we i assume you 're in this with me at this point need to get three words  for examination only  eliminated from the law.
section 501 of the united states information and educational exchange act of 1948 says voice material shall be available to certain of us but now thanks to the usia 's new position all of us  for examination only.
if those words were n't there the nice people at the voice would be able to send you the information or at the very least let you photocopy it.
this is not a trivial issue.
you have  raised important questions which ought to be answered : what does usia say about america abroad ; how do we say it ; and how can american taxpayers get the answers to these questions ?  a man wrote me a couple of years ago.
the man was charles z. wick.
at the time he was director of the he had no answers then.
now there are some.
this democracy is suddenly a little more democratic.
i feel pretty good about it.
mr. gartner is editor and co-owner of the daily tribune in ames iowa and president of nbc news in new york.
r. gordon mcgovern was forced out as campbell soup co. 's president and chief executive officer the strongest evidence yet of the power that dorrance family members intend to wield in reshaping the troubled food company.
herbert m. baum the 53-year-old president of the company 's campbell u.s.a. unit and edwin l. harper 47 the chief financial officer will run campbell as a team dividing responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named.
the board already has been searching for strong outside candidates including food-industry executives with considerable international experience.
wall street reacted favorably to mr. mcgovern 's departure and its implications.
in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange campbell 's shares rose $ 3.375 to close at $ 47.125.
the profit motive of the major shareholders has clearly changed for the better  said john mcmillin a food industry analyst for prudential-bache in new york.
mr. mcgovern was widely seen as sales and not profit oriented.
new managers would think a little more like wall street  mr. mcmillin added.
some of the surge in the stock 's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation which has contributed to volatility of campbell shares in recent months.
campbell 's international businesses particularly in the u.k. and italy appear to be at the heart of its problems.
growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in u.s. units.
for example campbell is a distant third in the u.k. frozen foods market where it recently paid 24 times earnings for freshbake foods plc and wound up with far more capacity than it could use.
similarly campbell 's italian biscuit operation d. lazzaroni & co. has been hurt by overproduction and distribution problems.
such problems will require considerable skill to resolve.
however neither mr. baum nor mr. harper has much international experience.
mr. baum a seasoned marketer who is said to have a good rapport with campbell employees will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the pepperidge farm unit.
mr. harper a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined campbell in 1986 will take charge of all overseas operations as well as pepperidge.
in an joint interview yesterday both men said they would like to be the company 's next chief executive.
mr. mcgovern 63 had been under intense pressure from the board * to boost campbell 's mediocre performance to the level of other food companies.
the board is dominated by the heirs of the late john t. dorrance jr. who controlled about 58  of campbell 's stock when he died in april.
in recent months mr. dorrance 's children and other family members have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity.
in august the company took a $ 343 million pretax charge against fiscal 1989 earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan.
the plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about 3,600 jobs.
but analysts said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing especially in europe and there were signs that the board became impatient.
campbell officials said mr. mcgovern was n't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure.
the company 's prepared statement quoted him as saying  the ceo succession is well along and i 've decided for personal reasons to take early retirement.
but people familiar with the agenda of the board 's meeting last week in london said mr. mcgovern was fired.
mr. mcgovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of 65 in october 1991  unless i get fired.
campbell said mr. mcgovern had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting scheduled for nov. 17.
for fiscal 1989 mr. mcgovern received a salary of $ 877,663.
he owns about 45,000 shares of campbell stock and has options to buy more than 100,000 additional shares.
he will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $ 244,000 with certain other fringe benefits.
during mr. mcgovern 's nine-year term as president the company 's sales rose to $ 5.7 billion from $ 2.8 billion and net income increased to $ 274 million from $ 130 million the statement said.
mr. baum said he and mr. harper both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early 1988.
you 've got to make the restructuring work  said mr. baum.
you 've got to make those savings now.
mr. harper expressed confidence that he and mr. baum can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company.
we look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team  he said.
he predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive.
mr. baum said the two have orders to  focus on bottom-line profits  and to  take a hard look at our businesses what is good what is not so good.
analysts generally applaud the performance of campbell u.s.a. the company 's largest division which posted 6  unit sales growth and a 15  improvement in operating profit for fiscal 1989.
the way that we 've been managing campbell u.s.a. can hopefully spread to other areas of the company  mr. baum said.
in the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon both men exuded confidence and seemed to work well together.
you 've got two champions sitting right before you  said mr. baum.
we play to win.

robert l. bernstein chairman and president of random house inc. announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for 23 years.
a successor was n't named which fueled speculation that mr. bernstein may have clashed with s.i. newhouse jr. whose family company advance publications inc. owns random house.
abrupt departures are n't unheard of within the newhouse empire.
in an interview mr. bernstein said his departure  evolved out of discussions with si newhouse and that 's the decision i reached.
he declined to elaborate other than to say  it just seemed the right thing to do at this minute.
sometimes you just go with your gut.
mr. bernstein said he will stay until dec. 31 and work with his successor who is to be named soon.
mr. newhouse meanwhile insisted that he is n't unhappy with mr. bernstein or the performance of random house the largest trade publishing house in the u.s.
the company said the publisher 's annual sales volume increased to $ 800 million from $ 40 million during mr. bernstein 's tenure.
bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly  said mr. newhouse.
the company is doing well it 's stable it 's got good people.
bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time.
publishing officials believe that while random house has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily.
crown publishing group acquired last year is said to be turning in disappointing results.
as a private company random house does n't report its earnings.
mr. bernstein who succeeded bennett cerf has been only the second president of random house since it was founded in 1925.
speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house.
possible candidates include susan petersen president of ballantine/del rey/fawcett random house 's huge and successful paperback division.
some say anthony cheetham head of a recently acquired british company century hutchinson could be chosen.
there is also speculation that mr. newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another newhouse family member to run the business side in combination with a publishing executive like robert gottlieb who left random house 's alfred a. knopf to run the new yorker also owned by the newhouse family.
not included on the most-likely-successor list are joni evans recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for random house and sonny mehta president of the prestigious alfred a. knopf unit.
when ms. evans took her job several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time administrator.
mr. mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently.
mr. bernstein a tall energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues.
congress learned during the reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words :  provided that no funds shall be spent.
this phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through congress.
it signals congress 's attempt under the pretext of guarding the public purse to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in article ii of the constitution.
this species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional.
the appropriations clause states that  no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law.
the prevailing interpretation of the clause on capitol hill is that it gives congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding.
this interpretation was officially endorsed by congress in 1987 in the iran-contra report.
as partisans of congressional power understand a  power of the purse  so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers.
it is not supported by the text or history of the constitution.
the framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the constitutional convention of 1787 according to madison 's notes.
to the extent they did their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability.
moreover the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources 0 to perform the executive functions that the confederation congress had performed poorly under the articles of confederation.
it would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause technically a limitation on legislative power could be read as placing the president on congress 's short leash making the executive consist of the president and every member of congress.
as it went to the conference panel now deliberating the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by congress to rewrite the constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money.
during the coming weeks president bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them or alternatively to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of article ii and thus void and severable.
the 1990 appropriations legislation attempts *-1 to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by article ii.
article ii places on the president the duty to nominate  and by and with the advice and consent of the senate  appoint ambassadors judges and other officers of the u.s.
it also empowers the president to make recess appointments without senate approval :  the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.
yet section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides :  no part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person.
thus with one brief passage in an appropriations bill congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under article ii.
section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing.
the language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary.
the president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay because the anti-deficiency act prohibits voluntary service to the government.
the 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of  muzzling  provisions that violate the recommendation clause in article ii of the constitution.
muzzling provisions which might be called  blindfold laws  as well prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options let alone from recommending them to congress.
such laws violate the provision in article ii that requires the president to make recommendations to congress but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations.
typically these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations.
probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's office of management and budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny.
there is something inherently suspect about congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other.
perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than section 609 of the executive-office bill :  none of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this act shall be used to implement administer or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the united states.
this provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law since a one-house resolution could be said to be  duly adopted  even though it would require neither bicameral action in congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto.
the supreme court 's decision in ins v. chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional.
president bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives.
if president bush fails to do so in his first year he will invite congress for the remainder of his presidency to rewrite article ii of the constitution to suit its purposes.
what becomes custom in the bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents including democrats to undo.
president reagan learned that lesson.
by 1987 then-speaker jim wright was discussing arms control in moscow with mikhail gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president through an appropriations rider to treat the soviets as though the senate had ratified salt ii.
if a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision declaring the rider restricting his article ii powers to be unconstitutional and severable.
the constitution does not expressly give the president such power.
however the president does have a duty not to violate the constitution.
the question is whether his only means of defense is the veto.
excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under article ii would be different from the line-item veto.
as discussed in the context of controlling federal spending the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives.
the excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability.
one could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president by exerting a power of excision to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers.
there is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills.
if congress does nothing president bush will have won.
if congress takes the dispute to the supreme court assuming it can establish standing to sue president bush might win.
in that case he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive.
if president bush loses at the court it might be disappointing as morrison v. olson was for the reagan administration.
but the presidency would be no worse off than it is now.
moreover the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice.
as it stands now congress presumes after the reagan administration that the white house will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down.
president bush should set things straight.
if he does not he will help realize madison 's fear in the federalist no. 48 of a legislature  everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex.
mr. sidak served as an attorney in the reagan administration.
his longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the duke law journal later this year.
despite one of the most devastating droughts on record net cash income in the farm belt rose to a new high of $ 59.9 billion last year.
the previous record was $ 57.7 billion in 1987 according to the agriculture department.
net cash income the amount left in farmers ' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income increased in 33 states in 1988 as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices the department 's economic research service reported yesterday.
most of those states set farm income records.
the worst crop damage occurred in the midwestern corn belt and the northern great plains.
what saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had  mortgaged  to the government under price-support loan programs.
with prices soaring they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at  considerable profit  the agency 's 240-page report said.
in less parched areas meanwhile farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices.
to the surprise of some analysts net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit states including indiana illinois nebraska and the dakotas.
analysts attributed the increases partly to the $ 4 billion disaster-assistance package enacted by congress.
last year 's record net cash income confirms the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s.
it also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year.
commodity prices have been rising in recent years with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year as the government curtailed production with land-idling programs to reduce price-depressing surpluses.
at the same time export demand for u.s. wheat corn and other commodities strengthened said keith collins a department analyst.
farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices as the nation 's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low.
all of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture  mr. collins said.
california led the nation with $ 6.5 billion in net cash income last year followed by texas $ 3.9 billion *u* ; iowa $ 3.4 billion ; florida $ 3.1 billion ; and minnesota $ 2.7 billion.
iowa and minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income.
despite federal disaster relief the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers according to the department.
many lost their farms.
department economists do n't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was.
indeed net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline.
at the same time an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn soybeans and other commodities causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the soviets.
last year government payments to farmers slipped to less than $ 14.5 billion from a record $ 16.7 billion in 1987.
payments are expected to range between $ 9 billion and $ 12 billion this year.
after years of struggling the los angeles herald examiner will publish its last edition today shut down by its parent hearst corp. following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper.
the demise of the 238,000-circulation herald once the nation 's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding 700,000 turns the country 's second-largest city into a one-newspaper town at least in some senses.
the los angeles times with a circulation of more than 1.1 million dominates the region.
but it faces stiff competition in orange county from the orange county register which *t*-44 sells more than 300,000 copies a day and in the san fernando valley from the los angeles daily news which sells more than 170,000.
nearby cities such as pasadena and long beach also have large dailies.
in july closely held hearst based in new york put the paper on the block.
speculation had it that the company was asking $ 100 million for an operation said * to be losing about $ 20 million a year but others said hearst might have virtually given the paper away.
an attempted buy-out led by john j. mccabe chief operating officer never materialized and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as  tire-kickers and lookee-loos  had filed through since.
the prospective buyers included investor marvin davis and the toronto sun.
the death of the herald a newsstand paper in a freeway town was perhaps inevitable.
los angeles is a sprawling balkanized newspaper market and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the mammoth times then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies.
the herald was left in limbo.
further the herald seemed torn editorially between keeping its old-time hearst readership blue-collar and sports-oriented and trying to provide a sprightly upscale alternative to the sometimes staid times.
hearst had flirted with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan.
the herald joins the baltimore news-american which folded and the boston herald-american which was sold as cornerstones of the old hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s.
many felt hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did if marginally because of its place in family history.
its fanciful offices were designed by architect julia morgan who built the hearst castle at san simeon.
william randolph hearst had kept an apartment in the spanish renaissance-style building.
analysts said the herald 's demise does n't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry.
the herald was a survivor from a bygone age  said j. kendrick noble a media analyst with painewebber inc.
actually the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end and the industry looks pretty healthy.
founded as the examiner in 1903 by mr. hearst the herald was crippled by a bitter decade-long strike that began in 1967 and cut circulation in half.
financially it never recovered ; editorially it had its moments.
in 1979 hearst hired editor james bellows who brightened the editorial product considerably.
he and his successor mary anne dolan restored respect for the editorial product and though in recent years the paper had been limping along on limited resources its accomplishments were notable.
for example the herald consistently beat its much-larger rival on disclosures about los angeles mayor tom bradley 's financial dealings.
the herald 's sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded.
robert j. danzig vice president and general manager of hearst newspapers stood up in the paper 's newsroom yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would fold putting more than 730 full-time employees out of work.
hearst said it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for 60 days.
some long-tenured employees will receive additional benefits the company said.
hours after the announcement representatives of the orange county register were in a bar across the street recruiting.
the reaction in the newsroom was emotional.
i 've never seen so many people crying in one place at one time  said bill johnson an assistant city editor.
so long l.a.  was chosen as the paper 's final headline.
i 'm doing the main story and i 'm already two beers drunk  said reporter andy furillo whom the times hired away several years ago but who returned to the herald out of preference.
his wife also works for the paper as did his father.
outside a young pressman filling a news box with an extra edition headlined  herald examiner closes  refused to take a reader 's quarter.
forget it  he said as he handed her a paper.
it does n't make any difference now.
olympia broadcasting corp. said it did n't make a $ 1.64 million semiannual interest payment due yesterday on $ 23.4 million of senior subordinated debentures.
the radio-station owner and programmer said it was trying to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions.
it said it needs to make the payment by dec. 1 to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt.
in september the company said it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business.
if you 'd really rather have a buick do n't leave home without the american express card.
or so the slogan might go.
american express co. and general motors corp. 's beleaguered buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the american express card.
the companies are giving four-day vacations for two to buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the american express green card.
they have begun sending letters explaining the program which began oct. 18 and will end dec. 18 to about five million card holders.
neither company would disclose the program 's cost.
buick approached american express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a  good credit history  and are  good at making payments  says a spokeswoman for the division.
american express also represents the upscale image  we 're trying to project  she adds.
buick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as  the doctor 's car  a product for upscale professionals.
sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier though industry sales fell.
but since the 1990 model year began oct. 1 buick sales have plunged 33.
for american express the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business.
traditionally the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses.
phillip riese an american express executive vice president says the promotion with buick is his company 's first with an auto maker but  hopefully -lcb- will be -rcb- the first of many  in the company 's effort to promote its green card as  the total car-care card.
to that end american express has been signing up gasoline companies car repair shops tire companies and car dealers to accept the card.
many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the american express card but few card holders realize this mr. riese says.
until now however buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through general motors acceptance corp. could n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates says a spokesman for the gm finance arm.
but gmac approved the buick program he says because the american express green card requires payment in full upon billing and so does n't carry any finance rates.
mr. riese says american express considers gm and buick  very sophisticated direct-mail marketers  so  by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability.
in addition buick is a relatively respected nameplate among american express card holders says an american express spokeswoman.
when the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases buick came in fourth among u.s. cars and in the top 10 of all cars the spokeswoman says.
american express has more than 24 million card holders in the u.s. and over half have the green card.
gmac screened the card-member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $ 45,000 who had n't  missed any payments  the buick spokeswoman says.
some 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with gmac.
these 3.8 million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off gmac 's advertised finance rates which start at 6.9  for two-year loan contracts.
a spokesman for visa international 's u.s. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards but does n't have plans for a tie-in similar to the american express-buick link.
three divisions at american express are working with buick on the promotion : the establishment services division which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card ; the travel division ; and the merchandise sales division.
the vacation packages include hotel accommodations and in some cases tours or tickets to local attractions but not meals.
destinations are chicago ; honolulu ; las vegas nev. ; los angeles ; miami beach fla. ; new orleans ; new york ; orlando fla. ; san francisco ; and washington d.c. a buyer who chooses to fly to his destination must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion 's ticket free if they fly on united airlines.
in lieu of the vacation buyers can choose among several prizes including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder.
card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a sweepstakes with buick cars or a hawaii vacation as prizes.
if they test-drive a buick they get an american express calculator.
this is n't buick 's first travel-related promotion.
a few years ago the company offered two round-trip tickets on trans world airlines to buyers of its riviera luxury car.
the promotion helped riviera sales exceed the division 's forecast by more than 10  buick said at the time.
the united kingdom high court declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a london borough council and commercial banks.
the ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the london borough of hammersmith and fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions.
as many as 70 u.k. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities.
an appeal is expected.
in response to the ruling gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before *-1 recovering much of the loss by the end of the session.
gilts or british government bonds which also fell sharply initially retraced some of the losses to end about 3/8 point lower.
the council which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over # 6 billion $ 9.5 billion lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals.
at one point hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10  of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings.
when two parties engage in an interest-rate swap they are betting against each other on future rates.
thus an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments.
in most of the british transactions the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks which would make fixed-rate payments.
as interest rates rose municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them.
the court hearing began in early october at the request of anthony hazell district auditor for hammersmith who argued that local councils are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities.
the council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal.
although the hammersmith and fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital-markets transactions the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils.
while this court ruling was only on hammersmith it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature  a solicitor representing one of the banks said.
already 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings.
other financial institutions involved include barclays bank plc midland bank plc security pacific corp. chemical banking corp. 's chemical bank citicorp 's citibank and mitsubishi finance international.
if the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways some market sources said.
banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils.
officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable.
the banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly.
in the aftermath of the stock market 's gut-wrenching 190-point drop on oct. 13 kidder peabody & co. 's 1,400 stockbrokers across the country began a telephone and letter-writing campaign aimed at quashing the country 's second-largest program trader.
the target of their wrath ?
their own employer kidder peabody.
since october 's minicrash wall street has been shaken by an explosion of resentment against program trading the computer-driven lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes.
but the heated fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market.
the real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards.
program trading itself according to many academics who have studied it is merely caught in the middle of this battle unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace.
the evidence indicates that program trading did n't in fact cause the market 's sharp fall on oct. 13 though it may have exacerbated it.
on one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on wall street the new guard consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms their pension fund clients with immense pools of money and the traders at the fast-growing chicago futures exchanges.
these are the main proponents of program trading.
defending their ramparts are wall street 's old guard the traditional stock-picking money managers tens of thousands of stock brokers the new york stock exchange 's listed companies and the clannish floor traders known as specialists who make markets in their stocks.
so far wall street 's old guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors.
the chicago mercantile exchange a major futures marketplace yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market and the big board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading.
stung by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage a common form of program trading for their own accounts in the past few days.
a few such as giant merrill lynch & co. now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients.
the old guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based in part because some old guard members feel their very livelihood is at stake.
some such as traditional money manager neuberger & berman have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators  stop the numbers racket on wall street.
big board stock specialists in a bold palace revolt began shortly after oct. 13 to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the big board to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading.
charles wohlstetter the chairman of contel corp. who is rallying other ceos to the anti-program trading cause says he has received  countless  letters offering support.
they said universally without a single exception : do n't even compromise.
kill it  he says.
wall street 's new guard is n't likely to take all this lying down for long however.
its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable.
program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them.
what 's more the last time major wall street firms said they were getting out of program trading in the aftermath of the 1987 crash they waited a few months and then sneaked back into it.
even some members of the old guard despite their current advantage seem to be conceding that the future belongs with the new guard.
last week robert m. bradley one of the big board 's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders ' organization surrendered.
he sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to big board chairman john j. phelan jr. in which he said the big board is too focused on machines rather than people.
he said the exchange is  headed for a real crisis  if program trading is n't curbed.
i do not want my money invested in what i consider as nothing more than a casino  mr. bradley wrote.
the battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations causing internal contradictions and pitting employee against employee.
at kidder a unit of general electric co. and other big brokerage firms stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away.
corporations like contel denounce program trading yet contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like bankers trust co. that are also big program traders.
the big board the nation 's premier stock exchange is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives.
its entrenched 49 stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs.
but the big board 's leadership over the specialists ' protests two weeks ago began trading a new stock  basket  product designed to facilitate program trading.
a lot of people would like to go back to 1970  before program trading mr. phelan said this week.
i would like to go back to 1970.
but we are not going back to 1970.
again and again program-trading 's critics raise the  casino  theme.
they say greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation 's free-enterprise system turning the stock market into a big gambling den with the odds heavily stacked against the small investor.
the public did n't come to the market to play a game ; they can go to off-track betting for that  says a. brean murray chairman of brean murray foster securities a traditional money management firm.
the program traders on the other hand portray old-fashioned stock pickers as the neanderthals of the industry.
critics like mr. murray  are looking for witches and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman  says j. thomas allen president of advanced investment management inc. a pittsburgh firm that runs a $ 200 million fund that uses index arbitrage.
just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection.
for all the furor there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage the most controversial type of computer-assisted program trading.
like other forms of arbitrage it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product in this case a basket of stocks in different markets in this case the new york stock exchange and the chicago futures markets.
that divergence is what stock index traders seek.
when it occurs the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks such as the 500 stocks that constitute the standard & poor 's 500 stock index in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market ; they lock in the difference in price as profit.
such program trades which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock occur in a matter of seconds.
a program trade of $ 5 million of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of $ 25,000.
to keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives traders must seize every opportunity their computers find.
the speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics profess to despise.
if you continue to do this the investor becomes frightened any investor : the odd lotter mutual funds and pension funds  says larry zicklin managing partner at neuberger & berman.
but many experts and traders say that program trading is n't the main reason for stock-market gyrations.
i have not seen one iota of evidence  to support restrictions on program trading says a vanderbilt university finance professor hans stoll an authority on the subject.
says the big board 's mr. phelan  volatility is greater than program trading.
the oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders but by news of the unraveling of the $ 6.79 billion buy-out of ual corp.
unable to unload ual and other airline shares takeover-stock speculators or risk arbitragers dumped every blue-chip stock they had.
while program trades swiftly kicked in a  circuit breaker  that halted trading in stock futures in chicago made some program trading impossible.
susan del signore head trader at travelers investment management co. says critics are ignoring  the role the -lcb- takeover stock -rcb- speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility.
many arbs are  overleveraged  she says and they  have to sell when things look like they fall apart.
like virtually everything on wall street the program-trading battle is over money and the traditionalists have been losing out on bundles of it to the new guard in recent years.
take the traditional money managers or  stock pickers  as they are derisively known among the computer jockeys.
traditional stock managers like to charge 50 cents to 75 cents for every $ 100 they manage for big institutional investors and higher fees for smaller investors.
yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with much less beat the returns of standard benchmarks like the s&p not surprisingly old-style money managers have been losing clients to giant stock-index funds that use computers to juggle portfolios so they mirror the s&p 500.
the indexers charge only a few pennies per $ 100 managed.
today about $ 200 billion or 20  of all pension-fund stock investments is held by index funds.
the new wall street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 big board stock-specialist firms.
these small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of 30  to 40  a year on their capital by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks.
the specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death bell.
and they believe the big board under mr. phelan has abandoned their interest.
the son of a specialist and once one himself mr. phelan has nonetheless been striving with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets.
meanwhile specialists ' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility.
when the sell programs hit you can hear the order printers start to go  on the big board trading floor says one specialist there.
the buyers walk away and the specialist is left alone  as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks he contends.
no one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation 's stockbrokers.
they are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market crash and the market 's swings since then.
small investors are absolutely dismayed that wall street is stacking the deck against them and these wide swings are scaring them to death  says raymond a. mason chairman of regional broker legg mason inc. in baltimore.
stockbrokers ' business and pay has been falling.
last year the average broker earned $ 71,309 24  lower than in 1987.
corporate executives resent that their company 's stock has been transformed into a nameless piece of a stock-index basket.
index traders who buy all 500 stocks in the s&p 500 often do n't even know what the companies they own actually do complains andrew sigler chairman of champion international corp.
do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs ?
oh you 're in the paper business  is one reaction mr. sigler says he 's gotten from his big institutional shareholders.
by this september program traders were doing a record 13.8  of the big board 's average daily trading volume.
among the top practitioners were wall street blue bloods : morgan stanley & co. kidder peabody merrill lynch salomon brothers inc. and painewebber group inc.
but then came oct. 13 and the negative publicity orchestrated by the old guard particularly against index arbitrage.
the indexers ' strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die.
there 's a lynch-mob psychology right now  says the top program-trading official at a wall street firm.
wall street 's cash cow has been gored but i do n't think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem.
too much money is at stake for program traders to give up.
for example stock-index futures began trading in chicago in 1982 and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched.
stock futures trading has minted dozens of millionaires in their 20s and 30s.
now on a good day chicago 's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the big board trades in stock.
now the stage is set for the battle to play out.
the anti-programmers are getting some helpful thunder from congress.
program traders '  power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way  says rep. edward markey a massachusetts democrat.
we have to have a system that says to those largest investors :  sit down ! you will not panic you will not put the financial system in jeopardy.
'  but the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon.
many people including the big board think that it 's too late to put the genie back in the bottle.
the big board 's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions but a total ban is n't being considered big board officials say.
you 're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks  says *t*-1 vanderbilt 's prof. stoll.
program trading is here to stay and computers are here to stay and we just need to understand it.
short of a total ban some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors do n't.
one such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement or the  good-faith  payment of cash needed to trade them to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks.
currently margins on stock futures purchases are much lower roughly 7  compared with 50  for stocks making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative.
program trading critics also want the federal reserve board rather than the futures industry to set such margins.
futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active.
higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell they say.
another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an  uptick rule  a reform instituted after the great crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices namely short sellers.
the big board 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price.
but in 1986 program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets.
a reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably.
program traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the  pricing efficiency  of the futures and stock markets.
james a. white contributed to this article.
fundamentalists jihad big board chairman john phelan said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild stock-price swings.
thus the band-wagon psychology of recent days picks up new impetus.
index arbitrage is a common form of program trading.
as usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept : two separate markets in different locations trading basically the same widgets ca n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different.
in index arbitrage the widget is the s&p 500 and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in chicago and the stock markets largely in new york.
to profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity someone who owns the s&p 500 widget in new york must sell it and replace it with a cheaper s&p 500 widget in chicago.
if the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the s&p 500 index he is likely to remain fully invested at all times.
few if any index-fund managers will risk leveraging performance by owning more than 100  exposure to stocks and equally few will want to own less than a 100  position should stocks rise.
by constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget index-arbitrage traders hope to add between 1  and 3  to the annual return of the s&p 500.
that represents a very thin  excess  return certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective.
the fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the s&p 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue.
as more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and eventually eliminated.
the current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the s&p 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market.
the new york stock exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares.
so if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget how did  program trading  evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers ?
all arguments against program trading even those pressed without fact conclude with three expected results after  reforms  are implemented : 1 reduced volatility 2 a long-term investment focus and 3 a level playing field for the small investor.
but many of these reforms are unneeded even harmful.
reducing volatility.
an index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in new york and chicago to cover all transaction costs.
arbitrage does n't cause volatility ; it responds to it.
think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for s&p 500 stocks usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in chicago.
a large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures.
arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from chicago to new york while functioning as a buyer in chicago.
the start of the whole process is the key - someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move.
why does this large hypothetical seller trade in chicago instead of new york ?
perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade.
in a competitive market this investor has many ways to execute his transactions and he will have more alternatives both foreign and domestic if his volume is profitable 0 for an exchange to handle.
if not chicago then in new york ; if not the u.s. then overseas.
volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity.
eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising creating more volatility instead of less.
the speed of his transaction is n't to be feared either because faster and cleaner execution is desirable not loathsome.
if slowing things down could reduce volatility stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future.
encouraging long-term investing.
we must be very cautious about labeling investors as  long-term  or  short-term.
policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the big board 's door saying :  buyers welcome sellers please go away !  the ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term.
a free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate.
in point of fact volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today.
periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change 1973-75 1937-40 and 1928-33 for example.
it is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream  foul  on program trading when the markets decline while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise.
could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?
some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled  program-trading volatility  could be far worse than the perceived problem.
in using program trading as a whipping boy fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stock-selection products.
they may however risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves.
how does a nice new tax say 5  on any financial transaction sound ?
that ought to make sure we 're all thinking for the long term.
getting a level playing field.
this argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading not because of its merits but because of the firms championing the cause.
the loudest of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors.
they continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell while their clients continue to hope for superior performance.
even with mutual funds the little investor continues to tolerate high fees high commissions and poor performance while index-fund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees lower commissions and less risk.
yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert studiously devouring press clippings on each company he follows.
almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences.
if spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors.
the sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue stellar performers first while leaving institutions to grapple with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter.
cost-effective index funds just are n't sexy enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay and that institutional customers refuse to pay.
each new trading roadblock is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their high-volume clients here or overseas.
legislating new trading inefficiencies will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors.
so what is next for program trading ?
left to its own devices index arbitrage will become more and more efficient making it harder and harder to do profitably.
spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor chooses arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit.
if government or private watchdogs insist however on introducing greater friction between the markets limits on price moves two-tiered execution higher margin requirements taxation etc. the end loser will be the markets themselves.
instead we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants.

some democrats in congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years.
the funding mechanism which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by president bush would affect the antitrust operations of the justice department and the federal trade commission.
as a part of overall efforts to reduce spending congress cut by $ 30 million the bush administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 which began oct. 1.
to offset the reduction congress approved a $ 20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers acquisitions and certain other transactions.
some democrats led by rep. jack brooks d. texas unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts.
but justice department and ftc officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them.
it could operate to augment our budget  james rill the justice department 's antitrust chief said in an interview.
under measures approved by both houses of congress the administration 's request for $ 47 million for the antitrust division would be cut $ 15 million.
the ftc budget request of $ 70 million about $ 34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement would also be cut by $ 15 million.
the administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as was appropriated in fiscal 1989.
the offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the hart-scott-rodino act.
under that law parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $ 15 million or more must notify ftc and justice department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions.
currently the government charges nothing for such filings.
proponents of the funding arrangement predict that based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year the fees will yield at least $ 40 million this fiscal year or $ 10 million more than the budget cuts.
when you do that there is not a cut but there is in fact a program increase of $ 5 million  each for the ftc and the justice department rep. neal smith d. iowa said during house debate.
but rep. don edwards d. calif responded that a recession could stifle merger activity reducing the amount of fees collected.
the antitrust staffs of both the ftc and justice department were cut more than 40  in the reagan administration and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period.
today is not the time to signal that congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen  mr. edwards argued.
any money in excess of $ 40 million collected from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the treasury at large.
corporate lawyers said the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions.
though some lawyers reported that prospective acquirers were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect government officials said they had n't noticed any surge in filings.
fall ballot issues set a record for off-year elections.
odd-year elections attract relatively few ballot issues.
but the 1989 fall total of 80 while well below 1988 activity shows  a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives  says patrick mcguigan editor of family law and democracy report.
he says the 10 citizen-sparked issues on state ballots this fall represent the most in any odd-year this decade.
ballot questions range from a maine initiative on banning cruise missiles to a referendum on increasing the north dakota income tax.

dialing 900 brings callers a growing number of services.

program trading is  a racket  complains edward egnuss a white plains n.y. investor and electronics sales executive  and it 's not to the benefit of the small investor that 's for sure.
but although he thinks that it is hurting him he doubts it could be stopped.
mr. egnuss 's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by wall street journal reporters across the country.
but like mr. egnuss few expect it to be halted entirely and a surprising number doubt it should be.
i think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor  says leo fields a dallas investor.
he notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading.
but he blames program trading for only some of the market 's volatility.
he also considers the market overvalued and cites the troubles in junk bonds.
he adds :  the market may be giving us another message that a recession is looming.
or as dorothy arighi an interior decorator in arnold calif. puts it :  all kinds of funny things spook the market these days.

she adds that legislation curbing it would be  a darned good idea.

those who still want to do it  will just find some way to get around  any attempt to curb it.
similarly rick wamre a 31-year-old asset manager for a dallas real-estate firm would like to see program trading disappear because  i ca n't see that it does anything for the market or the country.
yet he is n't in favor of new legislation.
i think we 've got enough securities laws  he says.
i 'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit.
peter anthony who runs an employment agency in new york decries program trading as  limiting the game to a few  but he also is n't sure it should be more strictly regulated.

and surprising numbers of small investors seem to be adapting to greater stock market volatility and say they can live with program trading.
glenn britta a 25-year-old new york financial analyst who plays options for his personal account says he is  factoring  the market 's volatility  into investment decisions.
he adds that program trading  increases liquidity in the market.
you ca n't hold back technology.
and the practice should n't be stopped he says because  even big players are n't immune to the rigors of program trading.
also in new york israel silverman an insurance-company lawyer comments that program trading  increases volatility but i do n't think it should be banned.
there 's no culprit here.
the market is just becoming more efficient.
arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets he says.
he adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual fund and volatility on a given day may hurt the fund.
but  i 'm a long-term investor  he says.
if you were a short-term investor you might be more leery about program trading.
jim enzor of atlanta defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge.

researchers at american telephone & telegraph co. 's bell laboratories reported they raised the electrical current-carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of 100 moving the materials closer to commercial use.
the scientists said they created small changes in the crystal-lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to 600,000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field.
the scientists said they made the advance with yttrium-containing superconductors cooled to liquid-nitrogen temperature or minus 321 degrees fahrenheit.
their report appears in today 's issue of the journal nature.
the finding marks a significant step in research on  bulk  superconductors which are aimed at use in wires for motors magnets generators and other applications.
scientists had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry.
superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when cooled.
a family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation but only if their current-carrying capacity can be raised.
the at&t advance shows how one aspect of the current-carrying problem can be overcome.
but  it wo n't lead to imminent use  of new superconductors cautioned robert b. van dover one of the at&t researchers.
he added that the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals.
such multi-crystal materials will probably be needed for commercial applications.
mr. van dover said the at&t team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large-scale commercial use.
still scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding because it demonstrates how to overcome the  flux pinning  problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors ' potential *t*-2.
the problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals limiting their current-carrying capacity.
mr. van dover said the crystal changes his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place preventing them from lowering current-carrying capacity.
mr. van dover added that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem.
determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed crystal-lattice patterns.
the at&t team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with  melt-textured growth  a process discovered earlier at bell laboratories.
the combined processes may significantly raise the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples.

although his team lost the world series san francisco giants owner bob lurie hopes to have a new home for them.
he is an avid fan of a proposition on next week 's ballot to help build a replacement for candlestick park.
small wonder since he 's asking san francisco taxpayers to sink up to $ 100 million into the new stadium.
as san francisco digs out from the pretty big one opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium.
a stadium craze is sweeping the country.
it 's fueled by the increasing profitability of major-league teams.
something like one-third of the nation 's 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums ranging from cleveland to san antonio and st. petersburg.
most boosters claim the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city.
pepperdine university economist dean baim scoffs at that.
he has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one private dodger stadium brought more money into a city than it took out.
stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community not create more of it.
voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium.
san francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago.
last month phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $ 100 million stadium bond and tax proposition.
its backers fielded every important interest on their team a popular mayor the chamber of commerce the major media and spent $ 100,000 on promotion.
but voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself and rejected it 59  to 41.
in san francisco its backers concede the ballpark is at best running even in the polls.
george christopher the former san francisco mayor who built candlestick park for the giants in the 1960s wo n't endorse the new ballpark.
he says he had candlestick built because the giants claimed 0 they needed 10,000 parking spaces.
since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces mr. christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal  games  of their own with the voters.
stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built.
miami dolphins owner joe robbie disagrees and he can prove it.
several years ago he gave up trying to persuade miami to improve its city-owned orange bowl and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds.
he did n't see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit.
this stadium shows that anything government can do we can do better  mr. robbie says.
but to moon landrieu the former new orleans mayor who helped build that city 's cavernous money-losing superdome questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance.
the superdome is an exercise in optimism a statement of faith  he has said.
it is the very building of it that is important not how much of it is used or its economics.
an egyptian pharaoh could n't have justified his pyramids any better.
but civilization has moved forward since then.
today taxpayers get to vote most of the time on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions.
reed international plc said that net income for the six months ended oct. 1 slipped 5  to # 89.7 million $ 141.9 million or 16 pence a share from # 94.8 million $ 149.9 million or 17.3 pence a share.
the british paper packaging and publishing concern said profit from continuing lines fell 10  to # 118 million from # 130.6 million.
while there were no one-time gains or losses in the latest period there was a one-time gain of # 18 million in the 1988 period.
and while there was no profit this year from discontinued operations last year they contributed # 34 million before tax.
pretax profit fell 3.7  to # 128 million from # 133 million and was below analysts ' expectations of # 130 million to # 135 million but shares rose 6 pence to 388 pence in early trading yesterday in london.
reed is paying an interim dividend of 4.6 pence up 15  from 4 pence a year earlier.
sales fell 20  to # 722 million.
earnings were hurt by disposal of operations in its restructuring reed said.
wall street 's big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered.
the reason : risks from the firms ' new  merchant banking  activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business erodes.
the downgrading of debt issued by cs first boston inc. parent of first boston corp. by moody 's investors service inc. coupled with a moody 's announcement that shearson lehman hutton holdings inc. is under review for a possible downgrade sent shivers through the brokerage community this week.
with the shudders came the realization that some of wall street 's biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably.
securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper or short-term corporate ious which they sell to finance their daily operations.
the biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper.
but moody 's warned that shearson 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon a move that would reduce shearson 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms.
shearson is 62%-owned by american express co.
just as the 1980s bull market transformed the u.s. securities business so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s  says christopher t. mahoney a moody 's vice president.
a sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible.
standard & poor 's corp. says first boston shearson and drexel burnham lambert inc. in particular are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead.
what worries credit-rating concerns the most is that wall street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings.
that 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors.
whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly wall street 's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years.
the recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays  in getting their money back says jeffrey bowman a vice president at s&p which raised a warning flag for the industry in april when it downgraded cs first boston.
wall street is facing a catch-22 situation  says mr. mahoney of moody 's.
merchant banking where firms commit their own money  is getting riskier and there 's less of it to go around.
in addition he says the buy-out business is under pressure  because of the junk bond collapse  meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks.
in a leveraged buy-out a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets.
in a recent report moody 's said it  expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry which combined with overcapacity will create poor prospects for profitability.
it said that the  temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor.
both moody 's and s&p cited first boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking which *t*-1 has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit.
the recent cash squeeze at campeau corp. first boston 's most lucrative client of the decade is proving costly to first boston because it arranged more than $ 3 billion of high-yield high-risk junk financings for campeau units.
in addition a big loan that first boston made to ohio mattress cowas n't repaid on time when its $ 450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn.
these two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of cs first boston 's equity  moody 's said.
total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity.
cs first boston however benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder credit suisse switzerland 's third largest bank.
shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business.
but its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail or individual investor business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the october 1987 stock market crash.
in addition shearson 's listed $ 2 billion of capital is overstated according to the rating concerns because it includes $ 1.7 billion of goodwill.
shearson  really only has $ 300 million of capital  says mr. bowman of s&p.
a shearson spokesman said the firm is n't worried.
a year ago moody 's also had shearson under review for possible downgrade  he said.
after two months of talks our rating was maintained.
drexel meanwhile already competes at a disadvantage to its big wall street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating.
the collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held drexel the leading underwriter in that market.
the firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal.
drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business cutting the firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000.
recently drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years.
the firm 's capital moreover has n't grown at the same rate as in the past officials at these firms say.
drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness.
we 're well positioned with $ 1.7 billion of capital  a drexel spokesman said.
and as a leading investment and merchant banking firm the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view.
moreover we 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the street in reducing costs which are down around 40  over the last six months.
lewis c. veraldi the father of the team that created the highly successful ford taurus and mercury sable cars retired early after experiencing recent heart problems.
most recently mr. veraldi 59 years old has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at ford motor co.
but he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car-development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the no. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company 's ford division to eclipse general motors corp. 's chevrolet division as the top-selling nameplate in the u.s.
under the so-called team taurus approach mr. veraldi and other ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers assembly-line workers auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle.
the concept 's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make ford 's product development more responsive to consumer demands.
it was later applied to other new-car programs including those that produced the ford thunderbird and mercury cougar.
ford chairman donald e. petersen said yesterday that mr. veraldi has  helped to change the world 's perception of american-made cars.
mr. veraldi worked at ford for 40 years holding a variety of car and parts-engineering positions.
the limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week when the supreme court refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm.
we can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of solomonic aid to those who 've been hurt.
but this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk technology and innovation.
too often now a single court decision becomes the precedent for other less compelling cases.
from the 1940s until 1971 some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol des to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness.
the drug was approved by the food and drug administration and marketed by some 300 pharmaceutical companies often under generic labels.
in the 1970s scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of des users.
the cases quickly went to court but the mothers of several thousand des plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used.
beginning in 1980 courts in several states including california and new york decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable.
courts made the assumption that all des pills were essentially the same and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales.
this has some logic.
drug makers should n't be able to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used.
but court quickly tumbled down a slippery slope.
just as all plaintiffs are not alike it turns out that des defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties.
the ultimate result came in hymowitz v. lilly where the highest new york court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove mindy hymowitz 's mother did n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages.
but as duke university law professor william van alstyne notes by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in new york for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in california.
despite the supreme court 's refusal to hear the case there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants.
the big problem however is that there 's no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited to des or to drugs.
the problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine.
the california supreme court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win des cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs.
the court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs citing the huge hidden social costs.
public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs even though some risks perhaps serious ones might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering  the unanimous court said.
the california justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug bendectin off the u.s. market.
this raises the key issue : what to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs ?
we now know that holding drug makers liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs wo n't be available to anyone.
as liability expert peter huber tells us after the hymowitz case if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug  it 's time * to sell that company 's stock short.
we also know that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway ; some win the legal lottery others get much less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either way.
des daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts.
congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs.
but a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children 's vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation.
everyone by now understands that congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving people without its becoming some billion-dollar morass.
we have no doubt this is one reason judges in new york and justices on the supreme court are willing to trash the law in the des cases.
they must figure that justice has to get done by somebody but know it wo n't be done by congress.
odyssey partners limited partnership an investment firm completed the purchase of may department stores co. 's caldor discount chain for $ 500 million plus the assumption of $ 52 million in debt.
caldor based in norwalk conn. operates 118 stores in the northeast ; it reported revenue of $ 1.6 billion last year.
may stores st. louis runs such well-known department stores as lord & taylor.
n.v.dsm said net income in the third quarter jumped 63  as the company had substantially lower extraordinary charges to account for a restructuring program.
the dutch chemical group said net income gained to 235 million guilders $ 113.2 million or 6.70 guilders a share from 144 million guilders or 4.10 guilders a share a year ago.
the 32  state-owned dsm had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter mainly to reflect one-time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations.
the charges were offset in part by a gain from the sale of the company 's construction division.
last year dsm had 71 million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions.
the earnings growth also was fueled by the company 's ability to cut net financing spending by half to around 15 million guilders.
also substantially lower dutch corporate tax rates helped the company keep its tax outlay flat relative to earnings growth the company added.
sales however were little changed at 2.46 billion guilders compared with 2.42 billion guilders.
allergan inc. said it received food and drug administration approval to sell the phacoflex intraocular lens the first foldable silicone lens available for cataract surgery.
the len 's foldability enables it to be inserted in smaller incisions than are now possible for cataract surgery the eye care and skin care concern said.
cataracts refer to a clouding of the eye 's natural lens.
a man from the bush administration came before the house agriculture committee yesterday to talk about the u.s. 's intention to send some $ 100 million in food aid to poland with more to come from the ec.
the committee 's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of poland 's own farmers.
rep. gary ackerman noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in el salvador and egypt.
however well intentioned food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country 's own farmers.
the first world has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other people 's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness.
it should be constantly stressed that poland 's farmers mostly need a real market for their products.
elco industries inc. said it expects net income in the year ending june 30 1990 to fall below a recent analyst 's estimate of $ 1.65 a share.
the rockford ill. maker of fasteners also said it expects to post sales in the current fiscal year that are  slightly above  fiscal 1989 sales of $ 155 million.
the company said its industrial unit continues to face margin pressures and lower demand.
in fiscal 1989 elco earned $ 7.8 million or $ 1.65 a share.
the company 's stock fell $ 1.125 to $ 13.625 in over-the-counter trading yesterday.
oshkosh truck corp. oshkosh wis. estimated earnings for its fourth quarter ended sept. 30 fell 50  to 75  below the year-earlier $ 4.5 million or 51 cents a share.
the truck maker said the significant drop in net income will result in lower earnings for the fiscal year.
in fiscal 1988 the company earned $ 17.3 million or $ 1.92 a share on revenue of $ 352.9 million.
oshkosh truck attributed the downturn in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis division a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations.
the company said it is in the process of phasing out john deere its current source of production for midsized motor home chassis.
in anticipation of the start-up of its new factory the company said a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built to carry it through the transition period.
tokyo stocks edged up wednesday in relatively active but unfocused trading.
london shares finished moderately higher.
at tokyo the nikkei index of 225 selected issues which gained 132 points tuesday added 14.99 points to 35564.43.
in early trading in tokyo thursday the nikkei index fell 63.79 points to 35500.64.
wednesday 's volume on the first section was estimated at 900 million shares in line with tuesday 's 909 million.
declining issues slightly outnumbered advancing issues 454 to 451.
investors switched trading focus quickly as they did tuesday reflecting uncertainty about long-term commitments to any issue or sector traders said.
speculation on the other hand sparked buying in certain incentive-backed issues though rumors underlying such shares eventually proved untrue.
the development traders said showed that there is more than ample liquidity available for investment despite the market 's recent directionless trend.
dealers led the market wednesday by actively trading for their own accounts observers said.
institutions mostly remained on the sidelines because of uncertainty regarding interest rates and the dollar.
the tokyo stock price index topix of all issues listed in the first section which gained 16.05 points tuesday was down 1.46 points or 0.05  at 2691.19.
the second section index which added 6.84 points tuesday was up 5.92 points or 0.16  to close at 3648.82.
volume in the second section was estimated at 18 million shares up from 14 million tuesday.
akio yamamoto managing director of nomura investment trust management said that if the u.s. federal funds rate declines to around 8.5  institutions would acquire a clearer idea regarding the direction of the market and thus more comfortably participate in active buying.
tokyu group mitsubishi estate and bridgestone/firestone which advanced tuesday declined on profit-taking.
wednesday 's dominant issue was yasuda fire & marine insurance which continued to surge on rumors of speculative buying.
it ended the day up 80 yen 56 cents to 1,880 yen $ 13.15.
due to continuingly high gold prices tied to uncertainty about the u.s. currency investor interest was directed toward oil and mining shares which traders called a  defensive  action frequently taken when the dollar is expected to fall or during times of inflation.
teikoku oil also stimulated by rumors of speculative buying advanced 100 yen to 1,460.
showa shell gained 20 to 1,570 and mitsubishi oil rose 50 to 1,500.
sumitomo metal mining fell five yen to 692 and nippon mining added 15 to 960.
among other winners wednesday was nippon shokubai which was up 80 at 2,410.
marubeni advanced 11 to 890.
london share prices were bolstered largely by continued gains on wall street and technical factors affecting demand for london 's blue-chip stocks.
the financial times-stock exchange 100-share index closed 17.5 points higher at 2160.1.
it rose largely throughout the session after posting an intraday low of 2141.7 in the first 40 minutes of trading.
the index ended the day near its session high of 2163.2 which was posted within the last half-hour of trading.
dealers said most investor interest was focused on defensive blue-chip stocks particularly those with limited u.k. exposure.
also several key blue chips were pushed higher in thin volume because of a technical squeeze among market makers.
sterling 's firm tone combined with a steady opening on wall street also tempted some investors to come back to the market dealers said.
there were concerns early in the day that wall street 's sharp gains on tuesday were overdone and due for a reversal.
the ft 30-share index settled 16.7 points higher at 1738.1.
volume was 372.9 million shares up from 334.5 million on tuesday.
dealers said institutions were still largely hugging the sidelines on fears that the market 's recent technical rally might prove fragile.
they cited wall street 's recent volatility and the lack of a clear indication over the market 's short-term direction as factors in the institutional caution.
jaguar a u.k. luxury auto maker being pursued by ford motor and general motors gained 10 pence 16 cents a share to close at 879 pence $ 13.90.
it shed about 7 pence however after dealers said the market was disappointed that ford did n't move to tender a bid for control of the company.
dealers said 0 the u.k. government 's decision tuesday to waive its protective  golden share  in the auto maker raised prospects of a bidding war between the two u.s. auto giants.
but the waiver also was seen as a signal that ford a major u.k. auto industry employer was able to gain government acceptance of its bid for control of jaguar.
dealers said that interpretation sparked expectations of an imminent bid by ford.
b.a.t industries which is being pursued by sir james goldsmith 's hoylake investments rose 9 to 753 on speculation that hoylake will sweeten its bid dealers said.
like jaguar b.a.t also eased off its highs in afternoon dealings.
reed international a u.k. publishing group gained 15 to 397 despite reporting a 3.7  drop in interim pretax profit.

dealers said the market agreed.
stocks boosted by market-makers shopping to cover book requirements in ft-se 100 shares included carlton communications which climbed 32 to 778.

criminal charges were filed against diceon electronics inc. and two company officials alleging waste disposal violations in its chatsworth calif. facility.
the los angeles county district attorney 's office filed seven felony and five misdemeanor counts charging that late last year and early this year the irvine calif.-based circuit-board manufacturer illegally disposed of acid caustic and heavy metals into the sewer system and stored hazardous materials in leaky unlabeled or open-top containers.
named as defendants were roland matthews president and peter jonas executive vice president and chief financial officer as well as a former plant manager.
the company said local authorities held hearings on the allegations last spring and had returned the plant to  routine inspection  in august.
the company does not feel that it or any of the individuals violated any criminal statute and the company expects full vindication in court.
arraignments are scheduled for nov. 14.
consumer confidence stayed strong in october despite the unsettling gyrations of the stock market.
the sharp stock market decline in late october appears to have had little or no effect on consumers  said fabian linden executive director of the conference board 's consumer research center.
survey returns received after the drop in the dow jones average were about the same as the views expressed prior to that event.
the nonprofit industry-supported group said its consumer confidence index was 116.4 in october barely changed from a revised 116.3 in september.
the index was 116.9 in october 1988 and in the past year has ranged from a low of 112.9 to a high of 120.7.
it uses a base of 100 in 1985.
in october more people said that present business conditions were  good  than in september.
an equal number in each month said that employment conditions were good.
and 19.6  of consumers contacted believed business conditions will improve in the coming six months compared with 18.3  in september.
also more people said conditions will worsen in the period.
fewer said conditions wo n't change.
in october 1988 21.1  said business conditions would improve.
in october 1989 16.9  said more jobs will be created in the coming six months compared with 17.4  in september and 18.6  in october 1988.
only 26.8  in october compared with 28.5  in september and 26.8  in october 1988 said income would increase.
the sustained level of confidence can be attributed to the continued favorable circumstances which affect the consumer 's day-to-day economic life  said mr. linden.
unemployment continues at a relatively low level providing a sense of job security and a low inflation rate has kept the purchasing power of the weekly paycheck reasonably strong.
the consumer confidence survey covering 5,000 u.s. households is conducted in the first two weeks of each month for the conference board by national family opinion inc. a toledo ohio market researcher.
buying plans were mixed in october with fewer households indicating plans to buy cars and more saying they will buy homes and appliances in the coming six months.
in october 6.7  of respondents said they will buy a car easing from september when 8.1  anticipated a purchase.
in october 1988 7.3  said they would buy a car.
home purchase plans increased to 3.3  from 3.1  in the two recent months.
in october 1988 3.7  said they would buy a house.
in 1989 home purchase plans have ranged monthly from 2.9  to 3.7  of respondents.
in october 30.6  said they will buy appliances in the coming six months compared with 27.4  in september and 26.5  in october 1988.
despite a deluge of economic news the treasury market remained quiet but the corporate market was abuzz over international business machines corp. 's huge debt offering.
there were so many economic reports but the market did n't care about any of them  said kathleen camilli a money market economist at drexel burnham lambert inc.
so the focus turned to other fixed-income markets corporate and mortgages in particular  she said.
ibm the giant computer maker offered $ 750 million of non-callable 30-year debentures priced to yield 8.47  or about 1/2 percentage point higher than the yield on 30-year treasury bonds.
the size of ibm 's issue was increased from an originally planned $ 500 million as money managers and investors scrambled to buy the bonds.
in the investment-grade corporate market  it 's rare that you get an opportunity to buy a name that has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features  said james ednie a drexel industrial bond trader.
money managers ranked ibm 's offering as the most significant investment-grade sale of the year because large issues of long-term debt by companies with triple-a credit are infrequent.
syndicate officials at lead underwriter salomon brothers inc. said the debentures were snapped by up pension funds banks insurance companies and other institutional investors.
in the treasury market investors paid scant attention to the day 's economic reports which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy.
whether you thought the economy was growing weak or holding steady yesterday 's economic indicators did n't change your opinion  said charles lieberman a managing director at manufacturers hanover securities corp.
the government reported that orders for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in september while construction spending was slightly lower.
both indicators were viewed as signs that the nation 's industrial sector is growing very slowly if at all.
a survey by the federal reserve 's 12 district banks and the latest report by the national association of purchasing management blurred that picture of the economy.
in a monthly report prepared for use at the fed 's next federal open market committee meeting on nov. 14. the nation 's central bank found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in recent weeks.
among other things the survey found that manufacturing activity varied considerably across districts and among industries.
the philadelphia and cleveland districts for example reported declines in manufacturing activity while the boston dallas and san francisco banks noted that business expanded.
the purchasing managers index of economic activity rose in october although it remains below 50.
a reading below 50  indicates that the manufacturing sector is slowing while a reading above 50  suggests that the industry is expanding.
mr. lieberman said the diverse showing in yesterday 's reports  only enhances the importance of the employment data.
the employment report which at times has caused wide swings in bond prices is due out tomorrow.
the average estimate of 22 economists polled by dow jones capital markets report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in october.
the economists forecast a 0.1  rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4.
treasury securities in a surprise announcement the treasury said it will reopen the outstanding benchmark 30-year bond rather than create a new one for next week 's quarterly refunding of the federal debt.
the treasury will raise $ 10 billion in fresh cash by selling $ 30 billion of securities including $ 10 billion of new three-year notes and $ 10 billion of new 10-year notes.
but rather than sell new 30-year bonds the treasury will issue $ 10 billion of 29year nine-month bonds essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark 30-year bond that was sold at the previous refunding in august.
credit market analysts said the decision to reopen the current benchmark the 8 1/8  bond due august 2019 is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face amount.
some dealers said the treasury 's intent is to help government bond dealers gauge investor demand for the securities given uncertainties about when the auction will occur.
the treasury said the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling.
until such action takes places the treasury has no ability to issue new debt of any kind.
meanwhile treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading.
the benchmark 30-year bond about 1/4 point or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount.
the benchmark was priced at 102 22/32 to yield 7.88  compared with 102 12/32 to yield 7.90  tuesday.
the latest 10-year notes were quoted at 100 22/32 to yield 7.88  compared with 100 16/32 to yield 7.90.
the discount rate on three-month treasury bills was essentially unchanged at 7.79  while the rate on six-month bills was slightly lower at 7.52  compared with 7.60  tuesday.
corporate issues ibm 's $ 750 million debenture offering dominated activity in the corporate debt market.
meanwhile most investment-grade bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/8 point higher.
in its latest compilation of performance statistics moody 's investors service found that investment-grade bonds posted a total return of 2.7  in october while junk bonds showed a negative return of 1.5.
moody 's said those returns compare with a 3.8  total return for longer-term treasury notes and bonds.
total return measures price changes and interest income.
for the year to date moody 's said total returns were topped by the 16.5  of longer-term treasury issues closely followed by 15  for investment-grade bonds.
junk bonds trailed the group again.
even the 7.2  return from the risk-free three-month treasury bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1  return from junk bonds  wrote moody 's economist john lonski in yesterday 's market report.
little wonder that buyers for junk have been found wanting  he said.
moody 's said the average net asset value of 24 junk-bond mutual funds fell by 4.2  in october.
mortgage-backed issues mortgage securities ended slightly higher but trailed gains in the treasury market.
ginnie mae 's 9  issue for november delivery finished at 98 5/8 up 2/32 and its 9 1/2  issue at 100 22/32 also up 2/32.

a $ 114 million issue of health facility revenue bonds from the california health facilities financing authority was temporarily withdrawn after being tentatively priced by a first boston corp. group.

the issue could be relaunched possibly in a restructured form as early as next week according to the lead underwriter.
a $ 107.03 million offering of santa ana community redevelopment agency calif. tax allocation bonds got off to a slow start and may be repriced at lower levels today according to an official with lead underwriter donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp.
the santa ana bonds were tentatively priced to yield from 6.40  in 1991 to 7.458  in bucking the market trend an issue of $ 130 million general obligation distributable state aid bonds from detroit mich. apparently drew solid investor interest.
they were tentatively priced to yield from 6.20  in 1991 to 7.272  in foreign bond west german dealers said there was little interest in treasury bonds ahead of thursday 's new government bond issue.
so far they said investors appear unenthusiastic about the new issue which might force the government to raise the coupon to more than 7.
it is generally expected to be the usual 10-year four billion mark issue.
rumors to the contrary have been that it would be a six billion mark issue or that the last bund a 7  issue due october 1999 would be increased by two billion marks.

the british department of trade and industry ordered an investigation of the competitive impact of michelin tyre plc 's planned acquisition of national tyre service ltd.
the department said it referred the takeover to the monopolies and mergers commission because of the purchase 's possible effects on the u.k. market for distribution of replacement tires.
btr plc a u.k. industrial conglomerate said in june it had sold its national tyre service business to michelin investment ltd. a u.k. unit of the tire maker for # 140 million $ 221.4 million.

rep. john dingell an important sponsor of president bush 's clean-air bill plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the white house on a centerpiece issue : acid rain.
the michigan democrat 's proposal which is expected today is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the bush administration 's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain.
the administration 's plan could cost utilities mainly those that use coal up to $ 4 billion a year.
the proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the house 's work on clean-air legislation.
as chairman of the house energy and commerce committee mr. dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation.
people close to the utility industry said mr. dingell 's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain though additional cuts could be ordered later.
mr. bush 's legislative package promises *-1 to cut emissions by 10 million tons basically in half by the year 2000.
although final details were n't available sources said the dingell plan would abandon the president 's proposal for a cap on utilities ' sulfur-dioxide emissions.
that proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth.
it also would junk an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among polluters.
in addition it is believed to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills.
the administration sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases has staunchly opposed cost-sharing.
mr. dingell 's staff was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members apparently in an attempt to appease midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing.
it is n't clear however whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the white house 's acid-rain plan.
while the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities it might not win the support of utilities many in the west that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels.
lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the white house to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns.
american city business journals inc. said its president michael k. russell will resign rather than relocate to new headquarters in charlotte n.c.

ray shaw chairman of american city said he would assume mr. russell 's responsibilities if a successor is n't found this month.

new york financier saul steinberg sought federal permission to buy more than 15  of united airlines ' parent ual corp. saying he might seek control of the nation 's second-largest airline.
although takeover experts said they doubted mr. steinberg will make a bid by himself the application by his reliance group holdings inc. could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management bid.
such an application for federal antitrust clearance is necessary for any investor that might seek control.
but some investors have used such filings to boost the value of their stock holdings which without buying more stock they then sold.
takeover stock traders were puzzled by the reliance filing and cautioned that it does n't mean mr. steinberg will definitely seek control.
maybe he just wants to make something happen  said one takeover expert.
one investment banker said mr. steinberg may be trying to position himself as a friendly investor who could help ual chairman stephen wolf revive a failed labor-management bid.
mr. steinberg he suggested could replace british airways plc which has withdrawn from the buy-out group.
reliance had already bought and sold ual stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse oct. 13 of the $ 6.79 billion $ 300-a-share labor-management buy-out.
reliance acquired a 7  ual stake early this year at an average cost of $ 110 a share and reduced its stake to 4.7  after ual accepted the bid at prices higher than $ 282 a share.
market sources said reliance has already sold its entire ual stake and thus would n't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock.
but the exact amount of reliance 's current holding has n't been formally disclosed.
the filing adds a new twist to market speculation that coniston partners a new york money manager has bought more than 5  of ual stock and may challenge the ual board 's decision last week to remain independent.
speculation about coniston has caused the stock to rebound from a low of $ 145.
ual 's announcement came after the market closed yesterday.
in composite new york stock exchange trading the shares closed at $ 177 up $ 1.50.
ual would n't elaborate on a statement that it had been notified of the filing by reliance.
reliance confirmed the filing but would n't elaborate.
some takeover experts were skeptical saying it was possible that mr. steinberg made the filing only to help boost the value of any remaining reliance stake in ual.
mr. steinberg is thought to be on friendly terms with ual 's mr. wolf.
the investor was instrumental in tapping mr. wolf to run the air cargo unit of tiger international inc.
mr. wolf 's success in that job helped him land the top job with ual in december 1987.

intelogic trace inc. san antonio texas said it bought 2.7 million shares or about 18  of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $ 3.625 a share or $ 9.9 million.
the move boosts intelogic chairman asher edelman 's stake to 20  from 16.2  and may help prevent martin ackerman from making a run at the computer-services concern.
mr. ackerman already is seeking to oust mr. edelman as chairman of datapoint corp. an intelogic affiliate.
the action followed by one day an intelogic announcement that it will retain an investment banker to explore alternatives  to maximize shareholder value  including the possible sale of the company.
in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday intelogic shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $ 2.75.
mr. edelman declined to specify what prompted the recent moves saying they are meant only to benefit shareholders when  the company is on a roll.
he added  this has nothing to do with marty ackerman and it is not designed particularly to take the company private.
but mr. ackerman said the buy-back and the above-market price paid prove that mr. edelman is running scared.

rockwell international corp. reported flat operating earnings for the fourth quarter ended sept. 30.
the aerospace automotive supply electronics and printing-press concern also indicated that the first half of fiscal 1990 could be rough.
in an interview donald beall chairman said first-half profit certainly would trail the past year 's primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets.
still he added if the industrial sector remains relatively stable rockwell should be able to recover in the second half and about equal fiscal 1989 's operating profit of $ 630.9 million.
for fiscal 1989 's fourth quarter rockwell 's net income totaled $ 126.1 million or 50 cents a share.
that compares with operating earnings of $ 132.9 million or 49 cents a share the year earlier.
the prior-year period includes a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the b-1b bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business which made net $ 185.9 million or 70 cents a share.
sales rose 4  to $ 3.28 billion from $ 3.16 billion.
mr. beall said that he was generally pleased with the latest numbers and cited a particularly strong showing by the company 's electronics segment.
overall pretax electronics earnings soared 12  to $ 107.9 million from $ 96.4 million.
all four areas had higher revenue for the three months ended sept. 30.
for the year electronics emerged as rockwell 's largest sector in terms of sales and earnings muscling out aerospace for the first time.
the graphics business which also was singled out by the chairman as a positive saw its operating earnings for the quarter jump 79  to $ 42.1 million from $ 23.5 million.
for the year bolstered by the introduction of the colorliner newspaper-printing press graphics earnings almost doubled.
aerospace earnings sagged 37  for the quarter and 15  for the year largely due to lower b-1b program profit ; the last of the bombers rolled out in april 1988.
that was partially offset by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines.
the company also took hits in the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1988 on a fixed-price weapons-modernization development program probably the c-130 gunship according to analysts.
for fiscal 1989 the company posted net of $ 734.9 million or $ 2.87 a share down from $ 811.9 million or $ 3.04 a share in fiscal 1988.
excluding one-time additions to profit in each year earnings per share were $ 2.47 up 7.4  from $ 2.30 in fiscal 1988.
sales for the year rose 5  to $ 12.52 billion from $ 11.95 billion in fiscal 1988.

world sugar futures prices soared on rumors that brazil a major grower and exporter might not ship sugar this crop year and next.
prices also were boosted by another rumor that mexico usually a large producer and exporter might have to buy a large quantity of sugar.
although traders rushed to buy futures contracts many remained skeptical about the brazilian development which could n't be confirmed analysts said.
the march and may contracts rose to fresh life-of-contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents at their best levels of the day.
the march delivery which has no limits settled at 14.53 cents up 0.56 cent a pound.
the may contract which also is without restraints ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents.
the july delivery rose its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cent a pound to 14.00 cents while other contract months showed near-limit advances.
according to reports carried by various news services the brazilian government told its sugar producers that they wo n't be allowed to export sugar during the current 1989-90 season which began may 1 and the 1990-91 season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel.
one analyst arthur stevenson of prudential-bache securities new york estimated that 65  or more of brazil 's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and ca n't use gasoline.
this is a demand that must be met regardless of the price of oil  said mr. stevenson.
brazil is the third-largest producer and the fifth-largest exporter of sugar in the world.
a shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected but the latest news if true indicates a more drastic shift than had been anticipated.
during the current crop year brazil was expected to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988-89.
its 1989-90 exports were expected to total 645,000 tons in contrast to shipments of 1.5 million tons in  it is these 645,000 tons that are in question for this crop year  explained judith ganes analyst for shearson lehman hutton new york.
producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued  yesterday.
as a result ms. ganes said it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989-90 crop has been shipped yet even though the crop year is six months old.
more than a half of all sugar produced in brazil goes for alcohol production according to ms. ganes.
also there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane and this change is being felt now she said.
most important ms. ganes noted  brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports.
thomas oxnard sugar analyst for painewebber in hackensack n.j. said :  i am highly skeptical that brazil will curtail sugar exports particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound.
above all mr. oxnard noted the situation is extremely confused.
professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation  he said.
it 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out such as the one saying exports will be suspended and no one can confirm it.
mr. oxnard observed that the situation in brazil is also very complicated.
on the one hand brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program.
it has to weigh on the other hand the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol  mr. oxnard said.
mexico which is normally a sugar exporter has had production problems in the past two years analysts said.
last year it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments they noted.
this year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs analysts said.

grains and soybeans : prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come.

continued export demand also supported prices.
as an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the u.s. market analysts said that late tuesday the chinese government which often buys u.s. grains in quantity turned instead to britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat.
traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the soviet union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the u.s.
that designation would among other things provide more generous credit terms under which the soviets could purchase grain.
the soviets are widely believed to need additional supplies despite running up record one-month purchases of 310 million bushels of corn in october.
copper : futures prices rose extending tuesday 's gains.
the december contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $ 1.1650.

by comparison for the first nine months xerox earned $ 492 million or $ 4.55 a share on revenue of $ 12.97 billion.
earnings at xerox 's financial-services operations actually rose slightly but that was largely because capital gains at crum & forster offset hurricane hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments.
property/casualty insurance has been a tough business in recent quarters as pricing has been cutthroat and natural disasters such as hurricane hugo and the california earthquake have resulted in huge payments.

junk-bond markdowns an ongoing securities and exchange commission investigation a drexel burnham lambert connection a fizzled buy-out rumor.
all this has cast a pall over columbia savings & loan association and its high-rolling 43-year-old chairman thomas spiegel who built the $ 12.7 billion beverly hills calif. thrift with high-yield junk bonds.
bears have targeted columbia 's stock because of the thrift 's exposure to the shaky junk market.
and some investors fault mr. spiegel 's life style ; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in columbia 's jet planes.
columbia stock recently hit 4 1/8 after reaching 11 3/4 earlier this year on rumors that mr. spiegel would take the thrift private.
moreover junk professionals think columbia 's huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $ 4.4 billion was n't enough meaning another markdown could be coming.
but in recent days columbia has edged up closing at 5 1/4 up 3/8 yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure.
mr. spiegel 's fans say columbia 's southern california branches are highly salable and the thrift has $ 458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets.
that 's almost $ 10 of equity for each columbia share including convertible preferred shares though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion.
columbia has only about 10 million common shares in public hands.
the spiegel family has 25  of the common and 75  of the votes.
other big common holders are carl lindner 's american financial investor irwin jacobs and pacific financial research though the latter cut its stake this summer.
while many problems would attend a restructuring of columbia investors say mr. spiegel is mulling such a plan to mitigate columbia 's junk problems.
indeed columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold columbia 's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking.
columbia wo n't comment on all the speculation.
but like other thrifts it 's expected to seek regulators ' consent to create a distinct junk-bond entity.
plans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so.
new rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value then sell the bonds over five years.
that 's why columbia just wrote off $ 130 million of its junk and reserved $ 227 million for future junk losses.
but if columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature at full value unless the issuer goes bust or restructures the junk portfolio might do all right.
columbia a longtime drexel client wo n't provide current data on its junk.
but its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered *-2.
these were allied stores western union telegraph gillett holdings sci television and texas air though many other bonds in columbia 's portfolio also have lost value.
possibly offsetting that columbia recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ 70 million.
it also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $ 300 million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings.
one trial balloon mr. spiegel is said to have floated to investors : columbia might be broken up as mellon bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank.
but columbia 's good bank would be a regulated thrift while the bad bank would be a private investment company holding some of columbia 's junk bonds real estate and equity investments.
some think columbia 's thrift which now is seeking a new chief operating officer might be capitalized at say $ 300 million and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a california presence.
the thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity financial industry executives say.
meanwhile the bad bank with the junk bonds and some capital might be spun off *-1 to columbia shareholders including mr. spiegel who might then have a new career investors say.
it is n't clear how much a restructuring would help columbia stockholders.
but  the concept is workable you sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank  says thrift specialist lewis ranieri of ranieri associates in new york.
mr. spiegel 's next career move is a subject of speculation on wall street.
few people think mr. spiegel wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift which current rules would force columbia to become.
they are n't really a thrift  says jonathan gray a sanford c. bernstein analyst.
of course regulators would have to approve columbia 's reorganization.
and some investment bankers say a restructuring is n't feasible while the sec still is scrutinizing mr. spiegel 's past junk-bond trades.

genetics institute inc. cambridge mass. said it was awarded u.s. patents for interleukin-3 and bone morphogenetic protein.
the patent for interleukin-3 covers materials and methods used to make the human blood cell growth factor via recombinant dna technology.
sandoz ltd. has licensed certain manufacturing and marketing rights for interleukin-3 from genetics institute and is conducting preclinical studies with it.
interleukin-3 may help in treating blood cell deficiencies associated with cancer treatment bone marrow transplants and other blood-cell disorders genetics institute said.
the second patent describes bone morphogenetic protein-1 a substance that can induce formation of new cartilage.
the patent covers bmp-1 type proteins and pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating bone or cartilage defects genetics institute said.
the company added that it has filed patent applications  on a large number of different bmp proteins  and the patent on bmp-1 is the first it has received.
bmp products may be useful in fracture healing and in treating bone loss associated with periodontal disease and certain cancers the company said.
the bush administration 's nomination of clarence thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the american bar association gave mr. thomas only a  qualified  rating rather than  well qualified.
people familiar with the senate judiciary committee which will vote on the nomination said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the aba rating in hearings on the matter.
mr. thomas currently chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court.
groups have accused him of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies.
fourteen members of the house with jurisdiction over the eeoc have said they oppose mr. thomas 's nomination because of  serious questions about his judgment -lcb- and -rcb- respect for the law.
a senior justice department official however said the administration is n't worried about the aba rating.
we 're pleased the aba rated him qualified  david runkel the department 's chief spokesman said in an interview.
the aba gives a  qualified  rating to nominees it believes would perform  satisfactorily  on the bench.
in contrast the lawyers ' association gives a  well qualified  rating to those  regarded as one of the best available for the vacancy.
metallgesellschaft ag said it agreed to acquire 51  of lentjes ag from the ferdinand lentjes foundation.
terms were n't disclosed.
metallgesellschaft a diversified frankfurt west germany-based metals group said it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants.
lentjes ' product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own lurgi g.m.b.h. plant engineering unit the company said.
the move is part of a strategy to focus on its core metals trading processing and plant engineering activities while shedding peripheral units the company said.
lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks $ 434.4 million and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks.
the sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of lentjes stock.
a plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset by the recent weakness of frankfurt share prices.
the u.s. international trade commission issued preliminary rulings under the u.s. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from hong kong taiwan and south korea may be injuring a domestic industry.
because of the rulings the commerce department will continue to investigate complaints by u.s. sweater makers that the imports are reaching the u.s. at unfairly low prices in violation of the u.s. anti-dumping act.
the law defines unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter 's home market.
itc officials said final commerce department and itc rulings wo n't come until next march or later.
if both agencies find violations of the u.s. trade law the u.s. would assess penalty duties on the imports which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements.
imports of manmade-fiber sweaters in 1988 totaled about $ 405 million from taiwan $ 400 million from south korea and $ 125 million from hong kong according to the itc.
in another action the itc dismissed anti-dumping act complaints filed by du pont co. of wilmington del. against imports of neoprene a type of synthetic rubber from france and west germany.
these imports totaled about $ 17 million last year.
upjohn co. said it will offer an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge.
upjohn officials said they could n't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees and how many will participate in the retirement plan.
but the pharmaceutical company said it  anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan 's implementation will more than offset short-term costs.
the program available to upjohn employees 55 years old or older could increase an individual 's retirement benefits 10  to 20.
in addition upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay.
chairman theodore cooper called the program part of the company 's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and  an effective headcount-control program.
but some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have because few jobs will end up being eliminated.
it 's a cosmetic move  said jonathan s. gelles of wertheim schroder & co.
according to upjohn 's estimates only 50  to 60  of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan.
upjohn further estimated that about 50  of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced.
as a result upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide.
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange yesterday upjohn shares rose 87.5 cents to $ 38.875 apiece.
an upjohn spokesman said he had  heard nothing  to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation.
the company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan to ward off unwanted suitors.
the spokesman said it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy.
earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs the spokesman said.

feeding frenzy  henry holt 326 pages $ 19.95 a highly detailed account of the wedtech scandal begins on a reassuring note.
right up front in the preface co-author william sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity.
when offered a free trip from the bronx wedtech 's home to washington d.c. by one of wedtech 's principals he tells the reader  mindful of accepting anything of value from those i was writing about i declined.
any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers.
bribe by bribe mr. sternberg and his co-author matthew c. harrison jr. lead us along the path wedtech traveled from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the army and navy.
the book revolves around john mariotta the founder of the company and fred neuberger who became his partner soon after wedtech 's creation.
although started in 1965 wedtech did n't really get rolling until 1975 when mr. neuberger discovered the federal government 's section 8 a minority business program.
this is a johnson-era great society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses.
mr. neuberger realized that although of italian ancestry mr. mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in puerto rico.
the two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation.
instead of 50/50 it became on paper only two-thirds mariotta one-third neuberger and they were in the program and off to the races.
besides being a  minority-owned company  wedtech was located in the south bronx a blighted area made famous by jimmy carter in his 1976 presidential campaign.
the company plugged itself right into carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the south bronx and kept using the minority south bronx angle through the reagan '80s.
starting with congressman mario biaggi now serving a jail sentence the company began a career of bribing federal state and local public officials and those close to public officials right up to and including e. robert wallach close friend and adviser to former attorney general ed meese.
it made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling retaining politically connected  respectable  law firms investment bankers and political consultants including reagan confidant lyn nofzinger.
when necessary it sought and received assistance from organized crime.
sometimes the bribed became partners in the company.
wedtech management used the merit system.
if you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag but equity.
if you were not an effective crook you found yourself out in the cold a fate that eventually befell mr. mariotta the firm 's semiliterate  minority  person.
but despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy easy-to-read tabloid writing style  feeding frenzy  often falls short of gripping reading.
none of the scams show much ingenuity : auditors found crookery the first day on the job.
wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up.
the scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses mercedes cars beautiful women expensive clothes.
among the lot of them not one is wrestling with good and evil or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane.
the one character at least somewhat interesting was irving louis lobsenz a pediatrician who changed his name to rusty kent london and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack.
he enters the story toward the end just in time to get arrested.
absorbed in doling out  feeding frenzy 's  tidbits the authors gloss over the root causes of wedtech namely the section 8 a federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place.
they do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end  rigid affirmative action programs.
programs like section 8 a are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up.
numerous other scandals among them the ones at hud have the same characteristics as wedtech.
they take place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption.
why are programs like this not eliminated ?
feeding frenzy  does provide a few clues.
in and around all levels of government in the u.s. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party.
they know that whenever government is redistributing wealth regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment there is big money to be made in influencing brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government.
they are our version of the east bloc 's nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change.
how many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders ?
this is the real issue raised by the wedtech scandal.
mr. stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the new york state urban development corp. 1983-85.
the finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard waertsilae marine industries oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard 's backlog of 15 ships.
the new company will attempt to limit the shipyard 's losses participants said.
the situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business.
everything will be taken over by the new company  said christian andersson executive vice president of oy waertsilae former parent of waertsilae marine.
once its ownership is finalized the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease waertsilae marine 's shipyard facilities.
subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from waertsilae marine 's two big shipyards government officials said.
under an accord signed yesterday the government and union bank of finland would become major shareholders in the new company each injecting 100 million finnish markkaa $ 23.5 million.
oy waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa most of it as subordinated debt and take a minority stake in the new company.
customers holding contracts for waertsilae marine 's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital government officials said.
waertsilae marine 's biggest creditor is miami-based carnival cruise lines inc.
carnival which has three ships on order from waertsilae marine presented claims for $ 1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week.
waertsilae marine 's bankruptcy proceedings began tuesday in a helsinki court.
its plans to be acquired dashed comprehensive care corp. said it plans to sell most of its psychiatric and drug abuse facilities in california and some other assets to pay its debt and provide working capital.
in all the company hopes to repay $ 45 million in debt through the sales which will completely discharge its secured debt the company said.
in addition the company has replaced its president and chief executive naming w. james nichol head of the company 's contract health services to succeed b. lee karns.
mr. nichol said he was  extremely disappointed in the continuing deterioration of the company 's operations while it attempted to conclude the reorganization during the past four months.
concurrent with mr. nichol 's appointment comprehensive care moved its corporate headquarters from irvine calif. to st. louis where the company maintained its contract services offices.
mr. karns continues as chairman.
comprehensive care had agreed to be acquired by closely held first hospital corp. of norfolk va. but the sale sputtered almost from the beginning and finally collapsed last week.
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange yesterday comprehensive care closed at $ 3.75 a share up 12.5 cents.
ralston purina co. reported a 47  decline in fourth-quarter earnings reflecting restructuring costs as well as a more difficult pet food market.
the st. louis company earned $ 45.2 million or 65 cents a share compared with $ 84.9 million or $ 1.24 a share a year earlier.
sales in the latest period were $ 1.76 billion a 13  increase from last year 's $ 1.55 billion.
for the year ended sept. 30 ralston earned $ 422.5 million or $ 6.44 a share up 8.9  from $ 387.8 million or $ 5.63 a share.
this year 's results included a gain of $ 70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations.
sales for the full year were $ 6.6 billion up 13  from $ 5.8 billion.
ralston said its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in greenville n.c. the recent closing of a hostess cake bakery in cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company.
the battery plant which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products will be closed over the next year or so a spokesman said.
ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures which required higher advertising spending.
for years pet food volume was flat the company said.
its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases but also spent more on promotion.
the continental baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales it added.
ralston said its eveready battery unit was hurt by continuing economic problems in south america.
ralston shares closed yesterday at $ 80.50 off $ 1 in new york stock exchange composite trading.

the record corn-buying binge by the soviet union is causing serious bottlenecks in the u.s. grain pipeline.
the soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river barges and trains to move the recently harvested midwest crop to ports for loading onto soviet ships.
river barge rates have soared 40  this fall from a year earlier.
railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business.
and some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the soviets.
the soviet union bought roughly 310 million bushels of u.s. corn in october which is the most ever sold to the soviet union in one month from the u.s.
the soviet union wants much of it delivered by january which would be a strain in most years.
but it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the mississippi river on which flows much of the u.s. corn that is shipped overseas.
we are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record  said william dunton a u.s. agriculture department transportation expert.
it is going to be real tight.
because of persistent dry weather in the northern plains the water level on the upper section of the mississippi river is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at one time.
in a few weeks many barges probably wo n't be able to operate fully loaded south of st. louis because the u.s. army corps of engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the missouri river which feeds into the mississippi river.
the army corps is cutting the flow of the missouri river about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it.
barge rates on the mississippi river sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation.
but the army corps of engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month.
at st. louis the water level of the mississippi river is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the missouri river is slowed an army corps spokesman said.
similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years.
so far the grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the chicago board of trade.
many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers.
at the board of trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for december delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $ 2.375 a bushel.
corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought.
with the harvest winding down however some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as u.s. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver.
farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices.
because the drought reduced u.s. stockpiles they have more than enough storage space for their new crop and that permits them to wait for prices to rise.
in parts of iowa for example some grain elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 a bushel for corn.
many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel said lyle reed president of chicago central & pacific railroad co. of waterloo iowa.
it is n't clear however who would win a waiting game.
although u.s. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought the agriculture department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins.
some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts only to see little appreciation.
the public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped  said bill biedermann allendale inc. research director.
although much of this country 's export corn goes to new orleans by barge it is possible for exporters to sidestep the mississippi river by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port.
ports in the great lakes and atlantic coast can also relieve pressure on new orleans.
one railroad for example is already increasing its grain hauling service from indiana to baltimore.
and it is n't clear that the soviet union will stay on its record buying pace.
the soviet orders were compressed into the month of october because of delays.
the soviet union usually begins buying u.s. crops earlier in the fall.
but its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems.
in other commodity markets yesterday : energy : crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading but much of the action was in heating oil.
prices rose on the news that a sizable west german refinery was damaged in a fire tightening an already tight european market.
heating oil for november delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon up one cent on the new york mercantile exchange.
west texas intermediate for december delivery advanced 22 cents to $ 19.94 a barrel.
gasoline futures continued a sell-off that began monday.
precious metals : futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets.
december delivery gold fell $ 3.20 an ounce to $ 377.60.
december silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $ 5.2180.
january platinum was down $ 5.70 an ounce at $ 494.50.
precious metals gold in particular currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability according to william o'neill vice president of research at elders futures in new york.
the recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities  he said.
yesterday the stock market rose strongly creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders he said.
silver and platinum which have more of an industrial nature than gold were even weaker he said.
silver is also under pressure of  extremely high  inventories in warehouses of the commodity exchange he said.
yesterday these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces according to an exchange spokesman.
copper : futures prices partially recovered monday 's declines because chilean miners voted to strike.
the december contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $ 1.14.
in chile workers at two copper mines los bronces and el soldado which belong to the exxon-owned minera disputada yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow an analyst said.
reasons for the walkout the analyst said included a number of procedural issues such as a right to strike.
the analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks.
in the case of copper he said the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal.
also contributing to the firmness in copper the analyst noted was a report by chicago purchasing agents which precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold.
the purchasing management association of chicago 's october index rose to 51.6  after three previous months of readings below 50.
the september index was 47.1.
a reading below 50  generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy while a reading above 50  points to expansion.
the chicago report raised the possibility that the october survey of the national association of purchasing management would also show a reading above 50.

the nation 's largest steelmaker earned $ 175 million or 62 cents a share compared with the year-earlier $ 228 million or 80 cents a share.
the recent quarter includes pretax gains of $ 98 million from asset sales while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $ 61 million.
in the 1988 period usx also had a $ 71 million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement.
sales rose 5  to $ 4.4 billion from $ 4.2 billion.
the earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third quarter when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing.
however third-quarter operating profit fell 14  as usx sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments eliminating income from those operations.
among segments that continue to operate though the company 's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets.
peter marcus an analyst with painewebber inc. said that a downturn in the appliance industry coupled with sluggish automotive sales hurt usx results.
moreover usx exports more than other steelmakers and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure.
the company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the lorain ohio plant which now is a 50-50 joint venture with japan 's kobe steel ltd.
in the steel division operating profit dropped 11  to $ 85 million.
profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $ 33 a ton from $ 42 a ton last year and $ 53 a ton in the second quarter analysts said.
still usx fared better than other major steelmakers earning more per ton of steel shipped than either bethlehem steel corp. which posted a 54  drop in net income or inland steel industries inc. whose profit plummeted 70.
in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday usx shares closed up $ 1.25 at $ 34.625 as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales.
the rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that usx 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers '.
charles bradford an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets said usx may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year.
he said usx also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet than lower-priced structural goods.
the energy segment with a 15  rise in operating profit is clearly the company 's strongest.
higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the marathon oil co. unit to $ 198 million from $ 180 million.
the texas oil & gas division continues to operate in the red although losses narrowed to $ 9 million from $ 15 million.
usx announced in october that it was soliciting bids to sell txo 's oil and gas reserves.
proceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares.
the company noted that it has reduced debt by $ 1.6 billion since the end of 1988 and bought back about 15.5 million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of 1987.
usx has about $ 5.5 billion *u* in long-term debt and 257 million shares outstanding.
the announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor carl icahn had increased his stake in usx to 13.1  and threatened a takeover or other business combination.
mr. icahn has said he believes usx would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments.
profit for the nine months jumped 21  to $ 721 million or $ 2.62 a share from $ 598 million or $ 2.07 a share.
sales rose 10  to $ 13.8 billion from $ 12.5 billion.

two leading constitutional-law experts said president bush does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line-item veto.
professors philip kurland of the university of chicago and laurence tribe of harvard law school said any effort by president bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the constitution and the intent of its authors as well as the views of previous presidents.
a line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure.
mr. bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure.
a white house spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case.
but the two legal experts responding to an inquiry by sen. edward kennedy d. mass. wrote in a joint letter that the president  lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto.
the two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum mr. kurland is a conservative and mr. tribe is a liberal.
the two professors said the constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills not partial measures.
moreover they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items and there was no discussion of a line-item veto.
they also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the civil war and  all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach  of the president.
sen. kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power but that it would be a  reckless course of action  for president bush to claim the authority without congressional approval.

investors are appealing to the securities and exchange commission not to limit their access to information about stock purchases and sales by corporate insiders.
a sec proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company executives would undermine the usefulness of information on insider trades as a stock-picking tool individual investors and professional money managers contend.
they make the argument in letters to the agency about rule changes proposed this past summer that among other things would exempt many middle-management executives from reporting trades in their own companies ' shares.
the proposed changes also would allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often.
many of the letters maintain that investor confidence has been so shaken by the 1987 stock market crash and the markets already so stacked against the little guy that any decrease in information on insider-trading patterns might prompt individuals to get out of stocks altogether.
the sec has historically paid obeisance to the ideal of a level playing field  wrote clyde s. mcgregor of winnetka ill. in one of the 92 letters the agency has received since the changes were proposed aug. 17.
apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal.
currently the rules force executives directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies ' shares within about a month after the transaction.
but about 25  of the insiders according to sec figures file their reports late.
the changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives  who are really calling the shots  said brian lane special counsel at the sec 's office of disclosure policy which proposed the changes.
investors money managers and corporate officials had until today to comment on the proposals and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory mr. lane said.
the sec will probably vote on the proposal early next year he said.
not all those who wrote oppose the changes.
the committee on federal regulation of securities for the american bar association argues for example in its lengthy letter to the sec that the proposed changes  would substantially improve the -lcb- law -rcb- by conforming it more closely to contemporary business realities.
what the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot telltale  clusters  of trading activity buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time.
according to some estimates the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third.
the sec 's mr. lane vehemently disputed those estimates.
the rules will eliminate filings policy-making divisions such as sales marketing finance and research and development mr. lane said.
the proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports he said.
companies would be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time.
considered as a whole mr. lane said the filings required under the proposed rules  will be at least as effective if not more so for investors following transactions.
but robert gabele president of invest-net a north miami fla. company that packages and sells the insider-trading data said the proposal is worded so vaguely that key officials may fail to file the reports.
many investors wrote asking the sec to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately not a month later.
but mr. lane said that while the sec regulates who files the law tells them when to do so.
investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in congress he added.
the sec would likely be amenable to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis he said.
the nation 's largest pension fund which oversees $ 80 billion for college employees plans to offer two new investment options to its 1.2 million participants.
the teachers insurance and annuity association-college retirement equities fund said it will introduce a stock and bond fund that will invest in  socially responsible  companies and a bond fund.
both funds are expected to begin operation around march 1 subject to securities and exchange commission approval.
for its employees to sign up for the options a college also must approve the plan.
some 4,300 institutions are part of the pension fund.
the new options carry out part of an agreement that the pension fund under pressure to relax its strict participation rules and to provide more investment options reached with the sec in december.
the new  social choice  fund will shun securities of companies linked to south africa nuclear power and in some cases northern ireland.
also excluded will be investments in companies with  significant  business stemming from weapons manufacture alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
sixty percent of the fund will be invested in stocks with the rest going into bonds or short-term investments.
the bond fund will invest in high-grade or medium-grade bonds mortgages or asset-backed securities including as much as 15  in foreign securities.
the fund also might buy and sell futures and options contracts subject to approval by the new york state insurance department.
under two new features participants will be able to transfer money from the new funds to other investment funds or if their jobs are terminated receive cash from the funds.
the investment choices offered by the pension fund currently are limited to a stock fund an annuity and a money-market fund.

solo woodwind players have to be creative if they want to work a lot because their repertoire and audience appeal are limited.
the oboist heinz holliger has taken a hard line about the problem : he commissions and splendidly interprets fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting so he doesn't have to play the same mozart and strauss concertos over and over again.
richard stoltzman has taken a gentler more audience-friendly approach.
years ago he collaborated with the new music gurus peter serkin and fred sherry in the very counter-cultural chamber group tashi which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like messiaen 's  quartet for the end of time.
today the pixie-like clarinetist has mostly dropped the missionary work -lrb- though a touch of the old tashi still survives -rrb- and now goes on the road with piano bass a slide show and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop with a few notable exceptions.
just the thing for the vivaldi-at-brunch set the yuppie audience that has embraced new age as its very own easy listening.
but you can't dismiss mr. stoltzman's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight.
he believes in what he plays and he plays superbly.
his recent appearance at the metropolitan museum dubbed  a musical odyssey, was a case in point.
it felt more like a party or a highly polished jam session with a few friends than a classical concert.
clad in his trademark black velvet suit the soft-spoken clarinetist announced that his new album  inner voices  had just been released that his family was in the front row and that it was his mother 's birthday so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record.
he launched into saint-saens's  the swan from carnival of the animals  a favorite encore piece for cellists with lovely glossy tone and no bite.
then as if to show that he could play fast as well he offered the second movement from saint-saens 's sonata for clarinet a whimsical puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the stoltzman personality.
and so it went through the first half : an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces none longer than five minutes none that would disturb or challenge a listener.
mr. stoltzman introduced his colleagues : bill douglas pianist/bassoonist/composer and an old buddy from yale and jazz bassist eddie gomez.
an improvisational section was built around pieces by mr. douglas beginning with  golden rain  a lilting laid-back lead in to the uptempo  sky  which gave mr. stoltzman the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers.
bach 's  air  followed.
mr. stoltzman tied the composer in by proclaiming him  the great improviser of the 18th century  and then built on the image by joining with mr. douglas in some bach two-part inventions cleverly arranged for clarinet and bassoon by mr. douglas.
keeping the mood light the two then chanted and chortled their way through some murderous polyrhythms devised by mr. douglas as an alternative to hindemith 's dry theory-teaching techniques and then with mr. gomez soared and improvised on the composer 's tight  bebop etudes.
the end of the first half however brought what the standing-room-only crowd seemed to be waiting for : the pop singer judy collins who appears on  inner voices.
glamorous and pure-voiced as ever ms. collins sang joni mitchell's  for free  about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist to which mr. stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto and mr. douglas's lush setting of a gaelic blessing  deep peace.
deep peace  also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds beaches deserts sunsets etc.
it was all too mellow to be believed but they probably would have gotten away with it had they not felt compelled to add ms. collins's signature tune  amazing grace  and ask for audience participation.
that went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings.
was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half ?
or was it because ms. collins had gone ?
either way it was a pity because mr. stolzman offered the most substantial music of the evening just after intermission : steve reich's  new york counterpoint  one of a series of reich works that *t*-21 juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing.
-lrb- mr. reich 's new  different trains  for string quartet uses the technique magisterially.
-rrb- mr. stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it : he warned us in advance that  new york counterpoint  lasts 11 1/2 minutes.
he also unfortunately illustrated this intricate jazzy tapestry with mr. pearson's images this time of geometric or repeating objects in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from mr. reich 's piece and mr. stoltzman 's elegant execution of it.
the rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by charlie parker ornette coleman bill douglas and eddie gomez with pictures for the douglas pieces.
it was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled club but like the first half much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable.
is this the future of chamber music ?
managers and presenters insist that chamber music concerts are a hard sell but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is purged of threatening elements served up in bite-sized morsels and accompanied by visuals ?
what's next ?
slides to illustrate shostakovich quartets ?
it was not an unpleasant evening certainly thanks to the high level of performance the compositional talents of mr. douglas and the obvious sincerity with which mr. stoltzman chooses his selections.
but it was neither deep nor lasting : light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of brahms.
ms. waleson is a free-lance writer based in new york.
one of ronald reagan's attributes as president was that he rarely gave his blessing to the claptrap that passes for  consensus  in various international institutions.
in fact he liberated the u.s. from one of the world 's most corrupt organizations unesco.
this is the u.n. group that managed to traduce its own charter of promoting education science and culture.
ever since the remaining members have been desperate for the united states to rejoin this dreadful group.
now unesco apologists are lobbying president bush to renege on president reagan's decision to depart.
but we can think of many reasons to stay out for the foreseeable future and well beyond.
the u.s. along with britain and singapore left the agency when its anti-western ideology financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand.
the personal antics of agency director amadou-mahtar m'bow drew much attention such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as kgb plants and ejected from france and when a mysterious office fire was set just before congress sent accountants to trace u.s. funds.
mr. m'bow was an extreme case but even his replacement the more personally genial spanish biochemist federico mayor has had little success at achieving reforms.
several ridiculous projects continue including the  new international economic order  which means redistributionism from the west to pay for everyone else's statism.
the orwellian  new world information order  would give government officials rights against the press ; journalists would be obliged to kowtow to their government which would have licensing and censorship powers and indeed duties to block printing of  wrong  ideas.
unesco somehow converted the founding u.n. ideals of individual rights and liberty into  peoples ' rights.
million-dollar conferences were held to chew on subjects such as  ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament  and  the impact of the activities of transnational corporations.
the agency was so totally subverted from the high principles of its founding that even the soviets now wonder about an agency that seemed so congenial to them.
glasnost may be partly responsible but soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze last year admitted  the exaggerated ideological approach undermined tolerance intrinsic to unesco.
unesco is now holding its biennial meetings in paris to devise its next projects.
mr. mayor's hope that references to  press freedom  would survive unamended seems doomed to failure ; the current phrasing is  educating the public and media to avoid manipulation.
he hasn't been able to replace the m'bow cabal.
soviets remain in charge of education programs a former head of an african military tribunal for executions is in charge of culture and a hard-line polish communist in exile directs the human-rights and peace division.
of the agency's 2,750 staff members 230 are in the field working on actual projects such as literacy and oceanographic research.
the position of the united states which once contributed 25  of the budget is that nothing has changed.
john bolton the assistant secretary of state for international organizations told congress that the continuing  statist restrictive nondemocratic  programs make rejoining any time soon  extremely unlikely.
this hasn't much bothered the unesco delegates who last week couldn't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy 19th-century french chateau the agency somehow owns.
other countries including west germany may have a hard time justifying continued membership.
we see an even stronger argument against unesco than its unsurprising failure to reform.
this is that the reagan revolution spanning eastern europe and tiananmen square shows the power of ideas unencumbered by international civil servants or government functionaries.
free markets free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get muddled only when delivered through u.n. organizations which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home.
the babelists of the united nations are experts at obfuscation.
this can have its purposes at times but there's no reason to cloud the importance and allure of western concepts of freedom and justice.
we can see plenty of reasons to stay out and none to rejoin unesco.
researchers at plant genetic systems n.v. in belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops.
the researchers said they have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of pollen.
the gene thus can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself.
such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant thereby producing hybrid seed.
the new generation of plants will possess the flourishing high-production trait known as  hybrid vigor  similar to that now seen in hybrid corn.
the development could have a dramatic effect on farm production especially cotton  said murray robinson president of delta & pine land co. a southwide inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the u.s.
on a commercial scale the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains.
that's because the male part the tassel and the female the ear are some distance apart on the corn plant.
in a labor-intensive process the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant making it male sterile.
they sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby which then pollinate the male-sterile plants.
the first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as 20  more corn than naturally pollinated plants.
the vast majority of the u.s. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies.
a similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops such as cotton soybeans and rice.
the male part the anthers of the plant and the female the pistils of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other.
the anthers in these plants are difficult to clip off.
in china a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds.
at plant genetic systems researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility.
jan leemans research director said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants a major crop in europe and canada using as a carrier a  promoter gene  developed by robert goldberg at the university of california in los angeles.
the sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant.
mr. leemans said this genetic manipulation doesn't hurt the growth of that plant.
the researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop.
they attached a second gene for herbicide resistance to the pollen-inhibiting gene.
both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed.
the laws of heredity dictate that half of the plants springing from these greenhouse-produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible.
the application of herbicide would kill off the male-fertile plants leaving a large field of male-sterile plants that can be cross-pollinated to produce hybrid seed.
mr. leemans said the hybrid rapeseeds created with this genetic engineering yield 15  to 30  more output than the commercial strains used currently.
this technique is applicable to a wide variety of crops  he said *t*-1 and added that some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the peculiarities of each type of crop.
he said the company is experimenting with the technique on alfalfa and plans to include cotton and corn among other crops.
he said that even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted are hybrids the genetic approach will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers which costs u.s. seed producers about $ 70 million annually.
in recent years demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies including monsanto co. shell oil co. and eli lilly & co.
one technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant's pollen.
but there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans animals and beneficial insects.
however paul johanson monsanto's director of plant sciences said the company's chemical spray overcomes these problems and is  gentle on the female organ.
biosource genetics corp. vacaville calif. is developing a spray containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that are responsible for producing pollen.
this gene called  gametocide  is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days.
robert erwin president of biosource called plant genetic's approach  interesting  and  novel  and  complementary rather than competitive.
there is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds  he said.
mr. robinson of delta & pine the seed producer in scott miss. said plant genetic's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles doesn't automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops.
that's because pollination while easy in corn because the carrier is wind is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton.
it's one thing to say you can sterilize and another to then successfully pollinate the plant  he said.
nevertheless he said he is negotiating with plant genetic to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton.
a bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between nomura securities co. and industrial bank of japan two of the world's most powerful financial companies.
the clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in japan's once-cozy financial circles.
not only are japan's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work ; increasingly they're squaring off against one another in unprecedented public fashion.
already the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets even governments.
what triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a new zealand government bond issue.
nomura was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen -lrb- $ 352 million -rrb- borrowing in japan at a time when many japanese banks led by industrial bank of japan were pressuring the wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by new zealand's civil-service pension fund.
unwilling to put up new money for new zealand until those debts are repaid most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing forcing an embarrassed nomura to postpone it this week.
the dispute shows clearly the global power of japan's financial titans.
aside from nomura's injured pride the biggest victim so far has been the new zealand government.
barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues wellington's debt management office had been casting abroad to raise the 3 billion new zealand dollars -lrb- us$ 1.76 billion -rrb- to nz$ 4 billion it needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next june 30.
with japan's cash-flush banks aligned against it though raising money may be difficult.
not only can they block wellington from raising money in japan bankers here say but as the largest underwriters in the eurobond market they might be able to scuttle borrowings there too.
new zealand's finance minister david caygill lashed out at such suggestions.
he told reporters in wellington tuesday that the government hadn't guaranteed the loans to dfc new zealand ltd. an investment bank 80%-owned by the national provident fund and wouldn't bail it out.
it may very well be what the japanese banks want  he told radio new zealand.
i think it would be irresponsible and i am not about to be blackmailed by japanese banks or any other international interests.
no less significant than the japanese banks' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between japan securities and banking industries.
anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate and protect the two industries from each other.
both sides are jealously guarding their turf and relations have been at a flashpoint for months.
the banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business.
meanwhile the securities companies most of them smaller than the banks are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that wouldn't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks.
nomura the world's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field and industrial bank of japan japan's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad captain the opposing sides.
and their suspicions of each other run deep.
in the past year both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses.
nomura started a credit-card venture with american express co. that allowed cardholders to use their nomura securities accounts like a bank account attracting the wrath of banks.
and industrial bank of japan started up a london securities subsidiary that sells japanese stocks to non-japanese institutions overseas a move that stirred the anger of the stock brokerage firms.
the new zealand bond issue simply has brought the two institutions face-to-face.

it's going to be a tough league  promises the 47-year-old mr. campaneris.
there will be a lot of malice.
men who have played hard all their lives aren't about to change their habits he says.
nonetheless one can't help wonder whether the game will be just a little bit slower.

and expect slower fastballs.

in a surprise move the british government cleared the way for a bidding war for jaguar plc by agreeing to remove an obstacle to a takeover of the auto maker.
trade and industry secretary nicholas ridley told the house of commons yesterday that he will relinquish the government 's so-called golden share in the company as long as jaguar shareholders agree.
the golden share restricts any individual holding to 15  and expires at the end of 1990.
it was in jaguar 's best interests  for the company 's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible  mr. ridley said.
mr. ridley 's decision fires the starting pistol for perhaps a costly contest between the world 's auto giants for britain 's leading luxury-car maker.
both general motors corp. and ford motor co. have been trying to amass 15  stakes in jaguar.
ford which already has an unwelcome 13.2  holding is prepared to bid for the entire company and had lobbied the government to lift the takeover restrictions early.
gm has been negotiating a friendly transaction with jaguar that likely would involve joint ventures and an eventual stake of just under 30.
but the government 's action which caught jaguar management flat-footed may scuttle the gm minority deal by forcing it to fight for all of jaguar.
i ca n't believe they -lrb- gm -rrb- will let ford have a free run  said stephen reitman a european auto industry analyst at ubs-phillips & drew.
i am sure they will be going for a full bid.
many investors certainly believe a bidding war is imminent.
jaguar shares skyrocketed yesterday after mr. ridley 's announcement following their temporary suspension on london 's stock exchange.
in late trading the shares were up a whopping 122 pence -lrb- $ 1.93 -rrb- a 16.3  gain to a record 869 pence on very heavy volume of 9.7 million shares.
in the u.s. over-the-counter market jaguar shares trading as american depositary receipts closed at $ 13.625 up $ 1.75.
analysts expect ford will make the first move perhaps today with an initial offer of about 900 pence -lrb- $ 14.25 -rrb- a share.
such a proposal values jaguar at more than # 1.6 billion -lrb- $ 2.53 -rrb-.
speculation about a takeover fight has sent jaguar shares soaring in the past six weeks.
the share price was languishing at about 400 pence before ford 's sept. 19 announcement of its interest in a minority stake.
ford is  in the driving seat at the moment  observed bob barber an auto analyst at brokers james capel & co.
an aggressive ford bid for jaguar would put pressure on gm to make a better offer as the british company 's  white knight.
such a countermove could end jaguar 's hopes for remaining independent and british-owned.
but it is n't clear how long gm would be willing to fight ford for jaguar.
because of their longstanding rivalry gm just  wants to make sure ford pays a huge packet for -lrb- jaguar -rrb-  said john lawson an auto analyst at london 's nomura research institute.
people close to the gm-jaguar talks agreed that ford now may be able to shut out general motors.
it 's either going to be a shootout or there only may be one player in town  one person said.
another person close to the talks said  it is very hard to justify paying a silly price for jaguar if an out-and-out bidding war were to start now.
in a statement jaguar 's board said they  were not consulted about the -lrb- ridley decision -rrb- in advance and were surprised at the action taken.
the statement emphasized that holders representing 75  of the shares voting at a special shareholders ' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions.
jaguar officials in the u.s. noted that ford as jaguar 's largest shareholder now has the power to call for such a meeting.
u.s. auto analysts also noted that ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid.
jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened analysts add because fewer than 3  of its shares are owned by employees and management.
ford officials in the u.s. declined to comment on the british government 's action or on any plans to call a special jaguar shareholders meeting.
but gm officials said they too were surprised by the move which left them to  consider all our options and explore matters further.
although gm has u.s. approval to buy up to 15  of jaguar 's stock it has n't yet disclosed how many shares it now owns.
in a prepared statement gm suggested its plans for jaguar would be more valuable *ich*-2 in the long run than the initial windfalls investors might reap from a hostile ford bid.
our intensive discussions with jaguar at their invitation  gm said  have as their objectives to create a cooperative business relationship with jaguar that would provide for the continued independence of this great british car company to ensure a secure future for its employees and to provide an attractive long-term return for its shareholders.
jaguar was shocked by mr. ridley 's decision because management had believed the government would n't lift the golden share without consulting the company first.
indeed the government is taking a calculated risk.
mr. ridley 's announcement set off a howl of protests from members of the opposition labor party who accused the thatcher administration of backing down on promised protection for a privatized company.
the british government retained the single golden share after selling its stake in jaguar in the conservative government 's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election expected in late 1991.
it 's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with  observed daniel jones professor of motor industry management at the university of cardiff in wales.
the government already buffeted by high interest rates and a slowing economy has been badly hurt by last week 's shake-up in mrs. thatcher 's cabinet.
at the same time the government did n't want to appear to favor gm by allowing a minority stake that might preclude a full bid by ford.
mr. ridley hinted at this motive in answering questions from members of parliament after his announcement.
he said he was giving up the golden share  to clear the way so the playing field is level between all contestants.

during the plan period, an effective monitoring and evaluation system will be devised and institutionalized, which will not only ensure the timely implementation of projects but also encourage management accountability and performance oriented evaluation system in the public sector.
during this period, the average annual growth in gdp was 3.4 precent whereas the growth in per capita income was a mere 0.8 percent.
the people were despaired of their aspirations, enthusiasm and zeal to participate in development efforts by this process, which thus created a set-back to local development.
thus, the total trade deficit, which was rs. 16,594.2 million in 1990/91, increased to rs. 19,011.9 million in 1991/92.
even in terms of physical objectives the plan targets have, on the whole, been achieved.
before 1951, some development activities were undertaken but their scope was very limited.
upto the end of fy 1989/90, 7,330 km. of road facility was available in the country out of which 2,958km. was black topped, 1,658km. graveled and 2,714 km. fair weather road.
the growth rate in the past years in internal resources as a financing source for development expenditure stood at 16.4 percent at current prices and 6.1 percent at constant prices.
a national campaign entitled "back to the village" was initiated with a view to providing a village -oriented philosophical base to the panchayat regime.
this adversely affected the environment as well as the climate of the country.
the depth and extent of poverty, unemployment, the growing disparity between rural and urban sectors and unequitable distribution if development efforts on the days to come.
while jute and jute goods, rice, pulse and timber were main exportable in the initial years, the industrial finished products such as the woolen carpets and readymade garments became main exportable in the later years.
the main reasons for the balance of payment to be unfa vourable to the country during these years were the reduction of total export and the excessive increase in import resulting in great trade deficit.
while loan realization in comparison to loan disbursement was 37.2 percent in 1974/75, the overdue portion of the outstanding loan gradually increased to 58 percent in 1989/90.
drinking water programmes had been initiated especially in urban areas and some rural areas prior to 1960.
therefore, no satisfactory achievement could be made in the economic sector.
while executing the small irrigation projects, the concerned agency will have to explain clearly about cash voluntary labour and repair and maintenance expenses to be borne by the users ' committee, and should execute the project after getting written agreement from them on these provisions, construction expenses of the project will be operated by joint signature of the person nominated by the users' committee and the technical representative of the executing agency.
accordingly, 17,000 metric tons of polythene pipes are estimated to be put into use during this plan period.
if the revenue grows at this rate, the total revenue will reach 10.2 percent at current prices and 6.2 percent at constant prices of the gross domestic product.
similarly, in order to reduce the student enrolment pressure on existing campuses and provide job-oriented education to students, a 12-class higher secondary education (10+2) programme was initiated.
transport and communication: 3.
a total of 1,993,000 kilo liters of petroleum products in estimated to be required during the eighth plan period.
control of population growth : the available resources in the country cannot forever sustain the current rate of population growth.
policy changes and achievements during 1990 -1992 the main responsibility of the interim government formed after the restoration of the multi-party system through the historic people's movement of 1990 against the panchayat regime was to concentrate on two things: 1.
later from 1975 onwards it was felt that the foreign trade and the balance of payments situation needed to be coordinated with other aspects relation to monetary, fiscal, foreign exchange and production of the country and due attention should be paid to the close interrelations among them while formulating the economic policy.
with the objectives of attracting foreign investors, a new foreign investment policy was formulated.
by 1989/90 the number of total air fields reached 43.
this movement experienced a misfortune when it turned into a process of the selection of workers, replacing the election system, masquerading as unanimity.
at the same time, the genetic diversity of agricultural crops will be utilized for the development of export-oriented products.
efforts are currently underway to rectify this situation.
similarly, agricultural credit to the tune of rs. 1,220.2 million is expected to have been made available.
therefore, the extent if requisite investment of the plan was fixed on the basis of crude incremental capital output ratios.
the eight h plan policies have been so formulated that they will promote the sustainable growth of large as well as cottage industries.
these enterprises suffered as a result of over staffing, political intervention, inefficiency and the lack of accountability.
in spite of the slogans of balanced development having been raised even during the panchayat regime, development efforts were comparatively concentrated in developed and urban areas, which gave rise to great social and economic disparities among the regions.
the rehabilitation of the environment in terms of the magnitude of degradation that has occurred has become a momentous task for a century.
a new education plan was introduced in the form of a national education system, which in reality created a havoc in the education sector.
however, the economic stimulus of world war ii led to the establishment of the first modern industrial units nepal.
there had been no marked changes in the economic structure until the fall of the panchayat regime.
the capacity utilization of jute goods and beer industries was above 70 percent.
4.3 drinking water : attention was given towards providing drinking water facility right from the beginning of planned development.
in respect of several development activities, the private sector and non-governmental organizations can evidently be more effective in terms of cost, flexibility, motivation and initiative.
the market available to nepalese exporters in limited.
further, as not much attention was paid to the proper alignment of the rode during construction, the roads have not able to intensify the economic activities of the people living in the road corridors.
during the early 10 year period of the panchayat regime, there was predominance of agricultural goods such as cereals and jute in the field of export and following the gradual decline in export of these goods, the industrial goods such as woolen carpets and readymade garments occupied the prominent place in the later years.
employment generation and human resource development : the creation of productive employment opportunities in the country has been given top priority by this plan.
all these factors hindered a substantial growth in revenue surplus.
although agriculture sector contributes the most to gross national production, the development in irrigation has been less than expected.
in spite of huge past investment made in this sector, farming still depends, to a large extent, on rainfall.
the loan disbursement ration of the commercial banks which stood at 60.6 percent in june/july 1962, steadily rose to 70.1 percent in june/july 1990.
this growth rate is higher than that if the last three decades.
by the end of 1989/90, the total generation capacity including hydro and diesel in the country was 227.084 mw. while about 1 percent of the total population had access to electricity in 1960/61, 8.8 percent of the population could enjoy this facility by the end of 1989/90.
therefore, during the eighth plan period, foreign assistance will be sought only for such priority projects which may not be sustained through internal resources and due attention will be paid to ensuring the maximum effectiveness in the utilization of the assistance.
the planned outlay in the public sector was virtually achieved.
it was, indeed, not at all inappropriate on a conceptual le vel to create a basis for balanced regional development through the formation of development regions based on a realistic delineation of a north-south growth axis or development corridors.
however, while there is a regular complaint from people concerning the unavailability searcity of medcines and manpower in hospitals and health ectres, the burden of the increasing population on exerting a heavy pressure on social services, and this population growth has minimized the impact of development achievements.
in the irrigation sector, too, only 550,467 hectares of land had access to irrigation facility by 1989/90which comprised only 21 percent of the total land under cultivation.
at constant prices the figures thus stood at 1.8 percent and 1.7 percent respectively.
the other areas given emphasis were transport and communications, power, and agriculture, agricultural extension work and irrigation.
removal of unnecessary delays to accelerate the government of government policies c.
semi-government organisations, users' committees, private sector and nongovernmental organisations will be encouraged to be involved in the construction of small irrigation projects.
the installation of the tubewells will be gradually be transferred from the government to the private sector.
political decisions were often autocratic and feudalistic.
against this, 2,789,000 students attended classes by april 1990 and this works out to be 80 percent of that age group.
background of the eighth plan: development and expansionu of irrigation facilities is essential for increasing agricultural production required to ensure economic growth and security in food supply.
thus, a large segment of population is deprived of the basic necessities of life.
telecommunication service : a total of 57,320 telephone lines were distributed in 38 urban areas by mid january 1991, with one line serving 3200 people.
although a total investment of rs. 61,139 million is proposed for the public sector, it will be necessary to spend development out lay equivalent to rs. 113.479 million during the eighth plan period.
the net forging assets increased form rs. 6203.5 million in mid july 1989 to rs. 16,150.7 million in mid july 1991.
during the past two years also, the foreign trade deficit has increased and is the previous years.
in 1962- 63, the first year of the plan, rs 70 million were spent.
it is necessary to promote productive investment policies which encourage the private sector to save and to direct their investment from the unproductive sector like real estate to the sectors capable of achieving higher economic growth rate such as industry.
every year,there is a need to make huge investment on the repair, maintenance and operation of large projects.
the increased predominance of the industrial goods in the import trade composition in fiscal year  1990/91 continued to the subsequent year of 1991/92, too.
the contribution of taxes to gdp stood at 2.3 percent at constant prices from indirect taxes and 0.8 percent from direct taxes in 1972/73, which rose to 4.0 percent and 0.9 percent respectively in 1989/90.
irrigation projects in under-construction stage.
polythene pipes :  in view if the policy of expanding drinking water facilities, there will be an increase in the use of polythene pipes in the plan period.
thus, it became the foreign trade toward a specified goal of the economy during the first decade of the panchayat regime.
authority was not decentralized to local level bodies.
from the table, it clearly appears that ins spite of high priority accorded to private sector investment, the private sector's savings in likely to exceed its investment amount.
the economic condition of some segments of population deteriorated even further.
the rapid increase in population leaves only an insignificant portion of resources for development works.
out of the total students of the primary class of the age group 6 to 10, 182,533 had attended their classes in 1961 and this work out to be 14.4 percent of that age group.
thus, the share of industrial goods slightly declined from 69.1 percent in f.y. 1990/91 to 63.4 percent on f.y. 1991/92.
as regards the sale and distribution of production inputs in f.y. 1990/91, 72,719 metric tons of chemical fertilizers and 2,325 metric tons of seeds were sold.
the share of government consumption is expected to increase only moderately from 11.5 percent of the  gross domestic product in 1991/92 to 12.6 percent of the gross domestic product in 1996/97.
in 1991/92, the meager growth of 0.1 percent in agricultural sector are believed to provide  impetus to the growth rate of non â€“agricultural sector in the years to come.
in respect of the extension of airport facilities, the installation of terminal tower equipment was completed in tribhuvan international airport and at nepalgunj, dhangarhi, surkhet, simra and rumjatar air fields.
the foreign exchange reserve which stood at an amount equivalent to rs. 11,984.6 million in mid july, 1990, increased to rs. 19,270 million in mid july, 1991.
but the flow of investment could not be channeled to industries with long term benefits due to the lack of proper implementation mechanism, procedural constraints and administrative delay.
during the same period, the trade with overseas countries increased to 77.3 percent from 2.3 percent.
objective: irigation projects in the eighth plan will be implemented to achieve the following objectives: 1.
to increase agricultural production using appropriate irrigation technologies suited to varying geo-physical and climatic conditions of the country and that cause minimum negative impact on the environment.
the programmes receiving priority in this plan are: (a) agricultural intensification and diversification: it is being increasingly realized that the contribution of agriculture to the overall economic development of the nation is not only determined by the growth rate of agriculture but also by its pattern.
in the absence of convenient and likelihood of reducing the reliance on traditional sources of energy like forests in the immediate future.
therefore, it is necessary to give special emphasis on the mobilisation of internal resources.
the principal role of the government will be to develop physical infrastructure necessary for economic development, such as roads and communications, to bring the people so far left out into the mainstream of development, by providing basic social services such as health care, education and drinking water, essential to the long-term national development, the participation of the private sector in these areas, too, will be welcomed, the government will initiate a process of disengagement and disinvestment from a number of areas that may be managed more efficiently by the private sector without jeopardizing social interests.
in addition to this, the main causes of price increase were the increased cost of goods and services produced by corporations, rice in international price of petroleum products, industrial raw materials and other goods, change in foreign exchange rate and decline in production of the non- agriculture sectors due to trade and transit impasse between nepal and india etc.
therefore, in order to expand the export trade, due attention must be paid to the identification of new exportable products and the amelioration of quality standards of the export items.
present economic conditions the history of planned process of economic development in nepal is short.
at present, the average life-expectancy of the nepalese people is estimated to have reached 54 years.
while the current account had increased to rs. 10,254.9 million in f.y. 1990/91, it reduced to rs. 9,578.1 in f.y. 1991/92.
the primary items like raw materials and a few manufactured goods still hold prominence in the country's export trade.
it is also essential to curtail unproductive expenditures.
similarly, the number of technical manpower was considerably increased during this period.
one an average, the item deposits increased by 24.7 percent per annum and the incre ased in net capital and other liabilities was 35.2 percent.
in the industrial sector, emphasis was placed on the completion of projects already underway.
while the share of import was 13.1 percent in the gross domestic product (gdp) in fy 1964/65, it gradually increased to 20.2 percent in fy 1989/90 the export, however, showed only an insignificant increase during the same period period.
same procedure will be followed for repair and maintenance as well.
therefore, this plan has placed special emphasis on the awareness creation programmes to increase in the demand for family planning devices.
conclusion: viewed in the total perspective, in spite of massive investments made in the past, nepal still remains one of the  poorest nations of the world.
this is merly 6.5 percent of gross domestic product.
construction expenses of small and medium projects will be jointly borne by nepal government and the users.
many commissions were constituted and studies conducted on the issue of the decentralization of power.
therefore, there is a great need to achieve a consistent balance between the demand and the supply of timber and firewood by according priority to forestry development and by soliciting active participation of the people themselves in afforest ration activity.
because of the existing shortcomings, the second plan gave priority to activities which would the base for more comprehensive future plans.
there still persists the problem of maintaining the academic calendar, which has as adverse effect on students' future.
the hydroelectricity and irrigation facilities need to be expanded through necessary arrangements of means and resources for the maximum utilization of hydro power.
the increase in money supply during the plan period will be lim ited to 12.1 percent per annum, which will help in limiting inflation to about 9 percent.
past development efforts, achievements and constraints.
to attain this purpose, it will be essential especially to curtail the unproductive government expenditure, to increase the work efficiency of public undertakings, to monitor the price situation on a regular basis, to emphasize on the attainment of equilibrium in foreign trade and to improve the supply and distribution systems of essential commodities.
they economy had to face serious problems due to imbalance between resource mobilisation and expenditure, imbalance between savings and investments and between export and import and the lack of control over population growth.
the present democratic government will do away with such tradition and effectively implement policies ofdecentralization in all sectors.
it included some basic activities such as the reduction of birth rate, control of immigration, control of migration from hills to the terai and from villages to urban areas and maternal child health care.
expenditures incurred for the forest resources and botanical surveys, mineral exploration, surveys of irrigation and power potential and in the transport sector are in the respective departmental totals.
the sector lacked dynamism and was unable to establish the kind of growth which induces forward and backward linkages with other sectors of the economy.
the heavy reliance on forests for the total energy consumption of the country has led to a massive destruction of forests.
a little different picture emerges when the level of development outlay and sources of financing are analyzed.
an additional rs 70 million was to be made available as loans to the private sector for investment in agriculture and industry.
when implementing any project a fixed sum of money will be borne by nepal government and the rest by the users' committee.
partial convertibility in foreign exchange was introducted in february 1992.
hence, the pace of development of the industrial sector was slow in the past.
the review also showed that while the increase in money supply in the initial years was mainly caused by foreign assets, the same in the subsequent years was caused by excessive internal borrowings.
if an elementary machinery lick water million, diesel engine and bio-gas plants could be developed in the rural areas, it will contribute immensely to the development of food processing industries and cottage industries.
though emphasis was given on the development and expansion of the irrigation sector in the past periodic plans, its implementation part could not be effective.
during these years also, foreign grants and loans played a major role in maintaining a favourable balance of payments situation.
the revenue surplus stood at 2.8 percent of gross domestic product at current prices in 1974/75 and 2 percent in 1972/73 at constant prices.
considering the development of institutional infrastructures during the past period and also the priority accorded in the allocation of development expenditure to meet theabove objective, the achievements made in the agricultural sector in respect of pro duction and productivity appeared to be far from satisfactory.
even after the political changes of 1951-52 relatively little progress was made.
the trade and transit impasse between nepal and india made 1989/90 an abnormal year, which also contributed to the trade with india drop to its lowest that year.
in reality, records of cultivated areas previously left out were adjusted after cadastral surveys which led to an increase in the crop farming area giving rise to inflated estimates of agricultural production.
foodgrain production which stood at 3.152 million metric tones in 1961/62 reached only 5.698 million metric tones in 1989/90 with an average growth rate of 2.1 percent per annum only.
the agricultural sector alone contributes about three fifths of the gross national product and provides employment to nearly eight tenths of the entire population.
this methodology did not pay due at tention of the need to establish coordination between various internal and external variables.
for this purpose, necessary steps must be taken to check the revenue pilferage and explore new sources of government revenue, to broaden the tax bases and simplify the administrative procedures.
while in the beginning the kathmandu valley alone was the centre of attraction, a substantial increase in the number of tourists took place during this period due to the extension of trekking, mountaineering, national parks and other places of touristic attraftion outside the valley.
in the fiscal year f.y. 1990/91 (at f.y. 1974.75 constant prices), the shares of an agricultural and non- agricultural sectors in gross domestic product were respectively 59.4 percent and 42.1 percent, which are expected to be 57.9 percent and 42.1 percent respectively in f.y. 1991/92.
the requirement is expected to be met even through the production of the factory of the nepalese army.
compared to the seventh plan, a slight increase is proposed in the sectoral shares of investment in agriculture, irrigation, forestry, trade, hotel and restaurants and social services.

sets the type of mouse pointers to use.
contextdependent mouse pointers are helpful. they are enabled by default. however, they require overhead that you may want to do without.
when enabled, this will ensure that each pixel of an image gets mapped to a pixel on the screen.
this is the distance in pixels where guide and grid snapping activates.
tools such as fuzzyselect and bucket fill find regions based on a seedfill algorithm. the seed fill starts at the initially selected pixel and progresses in all directions until the difference of pixel intensity from the original is greater than a specified threshold. this value represents the default threshold.
when enabled, the selected brush will be used for all tools.
when enabled, the selected gradient will be used for all tools.
when enabled, the selected pattern will be used for all tools.

sets the monitor's vertical resolution, in dots per inch. if set to 0, forces the x server to be queried for both horizontal and vertical resolution information.
if enabled, the move tool sets the edited layer or path as active. this used to be the default behaviour in older versions.
sets the size of the navigation preview available in the lower right corner of the image window.
sets whether gimp should create previews of layers and channels. previews in the layers and channels dialog are nice to have but they can slow things down when working with large images.
sets the preview size used for layers and channel previews in newly created dialogs.
when enabled, the image window will automatically resize itself whenever the physical image size changes.
when enabled, the image window will automatically resize itself when zooming into and out of images.

ï»¿past development efforts, achievements and constraints.
the eighth plan is the first plan of the democratic government formed through popular elections following the restoration of democracy brought about by the historic people's ovement of 1990.
in this context, the perspectives of this plan are based on two principal contradictory factors.
these factors consist of, on the one hand, the positive aspects of the new aspirations and enthusiasm among the general public and, on the other, the negative aspects of the legacy of economic depravity left behind by the panchayat regime.
this challenge has been further compounded by the degradation of natural resources and environment.
these circumstances naturally call for political discipline, thrift and economic sacrifices.
under these trying conditions, too, the great expectations and enthusiasm obtaining among the people can serve as a primary source of energy for the process of economic modernization.
during the period prior the the restoration of democracy, a three year plan and five year plans were formulated and implemented.
thus, despite the intention of developing the nation rapidly through the utilization of planning as a development tool, the economy could not achieve the desired progress.
one of the primary factiors for this was the inability to clearly establish inte4rrelationship among the goals and among the objectives, priorities, strategies and programmes of the plans.
this led to the establishement of a tradition of adopting a new goal prior to the accomplishment of a previous one.
hence, there appeared to be a lack of continuity and longterm analysis in the process of selection and identification of goals.
the selection of strategies and priorities, too, reflected similar drawbacks and in spite of the considerable investment made during the period, no desired progress was achieved.
the distortions in policy matters, strategies and programmers as well as the weakness in implementation evolved as the characteristic features of the then periodic development planning process.
an evaluation of the major economic and physical indicators during this period presents a gloomy picture, although during the panchayat regime progress was made to a certain extent in areas like transportation, communication, health, drinking water, literacy and the ratio of student enrolments, but the economic achievements were vague and disappointing on the whole.
no economic changes were brought about in the life style of the majority of the population.
the economic condition of some segments of population deteriorated even further.
an analysis of the economic changes brought about by the planned development efforts in the past in presented below.
economic situation.
gross domestic product owing to the low growth rate in gross domestic product in comparison with the high growth rate in population, the percapita income recorded only a marginal increase during the period 1964/65 to 1989/90.
during this period, the average annual growth in gdp was 3.4 precent whereas the growth in per capita income was a mere 0.8 percent.
as a result of the low growth rate in per capita income, nepal happened to stand low even among the poorest nations of the world.
in the past, especially during the seventh plan period 19851990, it was estimated that there had occurred an unprecedented growth in agricultural production.
in reality, records of cultivated areas previously left out were adjusted after cadastral surveys which led to an increase in the crop farming area giving rise to inflated estimates of agricultural production.
efforts are currently underway to rectify this situation.
if the aforementioned unrealistic growth were excluded, the growth rate in percapita income during the seventh plant would be considerably lower.
various studies have been conducted for the purpose of quantifying the people living below the poverty line in nepal.
these studies have estimated that 4060 percent of the populations are living below the absolute poverty line.
according to the national planning commission estimates based on the assessment of available data, the percentage of the people living below the poverty line is put at about 49 percent.
thus, a large segment of population is deprived of the basic necessities of life.
there had been no marked changes in the economic structure until the fall of the panchayat regime.
the share of the agricultural sector in gdp was 65.1 percent in 1964/65, which recorded a slight downward trend by reaching 61 percent in 1989/90.
in addition, the mode of producti8ion continued to be traditional.
due to the lack of growth in employment opportunities in nonagricultural sectors, the labour force subsisting on agriculture could not be transferred to other sectors.
the reliance of the growing labour force on agricultural pursuit where labour productivity was already low led to a further decline in per capita production in agriculture.
the problem has been further compounded by the fact that the agricultural labour force has to rely excessively on the monsoon.
foodgrain production which stood at 3.152 million metric tones in 1961/62 reached only 5.698 million metric tones in 1989/90 with an average growth rate of 2.1 percent per annum only.
this increase, again, was due mainly to the expansion in the agricultural land reather than an increase in productivity or the use of agricultural inputs.
the efforts of this period were insufficient even to maintain past levels of average per capita agricultural production.
the per capita food grain availability was diversely affected owing to the low growth rate in food grain supply in comparison to the growth rate in population.
in the irrigation sector, too, only 550,467 hectares of land had access to irrigation facility by 1989/90which comprised only 21 percent of the total land under cultivation.
notwithstanding the encouragement provided for the development of the industrial sector in the past, this sector remained in its rudimentary stage.
the share of the manufacturing sector including cottage industries stood at about 5 percent of gdp and provided employment to only about 2 percent of the total labour force.
the sector lacked dynamism and was unable to establish the kind of growth which induces forward and backward linkages with other sectors of the economy.
although the growth rate of this sector in general has been marginally higher the that of the economy as a whole, some industrial units prospered as a result of protectionist policies.
this is, however, incompatible with the general trends towards economic liberalization.
capacity utilization in industries, profit yielding and investment with value added activities were slake.
no subsector under the industrial sector was able to attract either domestic or foreign investors.
instead, the total consumption expenditure during the past 16 years rose from 90 percent of gdp in 197475 to 93.9 percent in 1989.90.
this was mainly due to the increase in government expenditure from 7.6 percent of gdp in 1974/75 to 11.5 percent.
as a result of the increase in the consumption expenditure, the occurred a decline in gross domestic savings by 3.9 percent, thus bringing down thepercent to 6.1 in 1989/90.
this evidently led to increasingly heavy reliance on foreign savings in order to bear the burden of the increased investment.
while the gross investment comprised foreign assistance to the extent of 4.5 percent of the gdp in 1074/75, this reliance was estimated to have gradually risen and reached 12 percent in 1989/90.
3.2 sources of financing development expenditure an expansionary policy, especially on internal and external expenditure and borrowings, was adopted during this period.
the growth rate in the past years in internal resources as a financing source for development expenditure stood at 16.4 percent at current prices and 6.1 percent at constant prices.
these growth rates were insufficient to cope with the increasing development expenditure.
consequently, this led to an increased and heavy dependence of the economy on foreign aid.
revenue surplus during the period between 1972/73 and 1989/90 the revenue increased at the rate of 17.3 percent at current prices and 6.9 percent at constant prices.
a structural analysis of the revenue reveals that it depended entirely upon traditional sources of revenue, as new revenue sources were not tapped.
the contribution of taxes to gdp stood at 2.3 percent at constant prices from indirect taxes and 0.8 percent from direct taxes in 1972/73, which rose to 4.0 percent and 0.9 percent respectively in 1989/90.
in the past years the regular expenditure recorded an unprecedented high growth.
the regular expenditure increased by 18.4 percent at current prices and 7.9 percent at constant prices during the period from 1972/73 to 1989/90 the regular expenditure compared to gdp was 6 percent at current prices in 1972/73, which reached 7.3 in 1989/90.
thus, at constant prices the regular expenditure recorded as growth from 2.8 percent in 1972/73 to 4.5 percent in 1989/90.
a detailed analysis reveals that there occurred a fundamental directional change in regular expenditure from the fiscal year 1974/75.
there was and accelerated growth in the expenditure in defence, internal security and debt servicing.
consequently, the share of the regular expenditure in economic and social sectors showed a decline in the total regular expenditure.
this phenomenon corroborates the fact that the economy is increasingly becoming dependent on loans and the flow if financial resources channeled directly towards economic and social services for development is very much limited.
in addition, the expenditure under the economic services for the maintenance if physical infrastructures, which were created with large investment, remained low.
all these factors hindered a substantial growth in revenue surplus.
the revenue surplus stood at 2.8 percent of gross domestic product at current prices in 1974/75 and 2 percent in 1972/73 at constant prices.
this figure remained at 2.9 percents at current prices and 1.8 percent at constant prices in 1989/90.
deficit finance thus, the mobilistation of deficit finance became an important tool of resource mobilistation due to the decline in the revenue surplus and the lack of optimum utilization of foreign aid.
the rate of growth in deficit financing from 1972/73 to 1989/90 was 18.4 percent at current prices and 7.9 percent at 1972/73 constant prices.
foreign assistance due to limited internal revenue mobilistation, there was a growing reliance on foreign assistance for development expenditure.
there appeared there significant trends in forging assistance during this period.
firstly, there was a gradual increase in the share of foreign assistance in the development expenditure.
while the foreign assistance contributed 37.4 percent of total development expenditure in 1972/73, the figure increased to 61.1 percent in 1989/90.
thirdly, compared to the amount of loans sanctioned by foreign donor countries and agencies, their actual utilistation remained considerably low.
thus, the rapid growth in net foreign debts led to an increased burden on the economy.
thus, the debt obligations increased from 2.0 percent in 1972/73 to 42.9 percent of gross domestic product in 1989/90.1 due to the expansionary fiscal policies adopted during this period, the gross expenditure recorded and average annual growth rate of approximately 17 percent from fiscal years 1964/65 to 1989/90.
the level of total expenditure in gross domestic product was at 5 percent in 1964/65, which reached 22 percent in 1989/90.
on the other hand, during the same period, the share of revenue in gross domestic product reached to only 10 percent from 3 percent.
consequently, the gap between revenue and expenditure reached as high as 12 percent from 3 percent.
this led to an increased dependence on internal and external borrowings.
monetary and credit situation money supply increased at an average annual rate of 15.6 percent during the period from june/july 1962 to june/july 1990.
the main factors for the increase in money supply was due to the increase in foreign assets by 14 percent and in internal borrowings by 26.1 percent.
during the same period, while the private sector loans increased by 21.3 percent, the government sector borrowing recorded a growth of 28.5 percent.
these factors limited, to a certain extent, the activities if the private sector.
during this period, a contraction in the money supply was caused by large increase in time deposits and the gradual growth of capital and other items.
one an average, the item deposits increased by 24.7 percent per annum and the incre ased in net capital and other liabilities was 35.2 percent.
during this period, as shown by the review, money supply m2 recorded an average annual growth of 17.7 percent.
the review also showed that while the increase in money supply in the initial years was mainly caused by foreign assets, the same in the subsequent years was caused by excessive internal borrowings.
thus, the average annual growth in loans and investment during this period was 23.0 percent.
as regards the borrowings of government sector, there occurred and annual growth of 32.2 percent from 1964/65 to 1989/90.
the loan disbursement ration of the commercial banks which stood at 60.6 percent in june/july 1962, steadily rose to 70.1 percent in june/july 1990.
despite the insignificant success in the realization of principal in comparison to credit extension, the loan realization has increased at 16.8 percent per annum during this period.
while loan realization in comparison to loan disbursement was 37.2 percent in 1974/75, the overdue portion of the outstanding loan gradually increased to 58 percent in 1989/90.
the loan disbursement of the commercial banks increased at 17.8 percent per annum during this period.
the price of food and beverages increased at 9.8 percent whereas the pricfe of nonfood goods and services increased at 9.6 percent during this period.
besides, there was tremendous pressure on price following an increased money supply at an average if 21 percent per annum because of the big increase in government expenditure during the seventh plan 1989 90 period.
in addition to this, the main causes of price increase were the increased cost of goods and services produced by corporations, rice in international price of petroleum products, industrial raw materials and other goods, change in foreign exchange rate and decline in production of the non agriculture sectors â€“ due to trade and transit impasse between nepal and india etc. 6.
foreign trade and balance of payments situation 6.1 foreign trade an analysis of the data of the past years 19621990 reveals that the situation of foreign trade of the country was not in a good shape.
export at current price had increased at an average if 11.2 percent per annum during this period while the import had increased at 14.2percent during the same period.
total trade deficit during this period had increased at an average if 16.6 percent per annum due to a limited export base in comparison to import.
although considerable success was achieved in country wise diversification of trade for bringing about changes in its traditional situation, no significant achievement was made in achieving trade balance by increasing the volume of export through productwise diversification.
during the same period, the trade with overseas countries increased to 77.3 percent from 2.3 percent.
similarly, while the shares of export and import trade with india stood at 95.5 percent and 98.9 percent respectively in 1961/62, they gradually declined over the years to 12.7 percent and 25.2 percent respectively in 1980/90.
the trade and transit impasse between nepal and india made 1989/90 an abnormal year, which also contributed to the trade with india drop to its lowest that year.
besides, the main reasons for the gradual decrease in trade with india in the previous years were the decline in surplus of traditionally exported agricultural products for export due to their increased internal demand and the countryâ€“wise diversification in import if daily consumer goods, construction materials and industrial raw materials from other countries following the expansion of trade with them.
in the context of the trade structure of the country during this period, while the foods and raw materials constituted an important place in exp ort in the initial years, the industrial finished products replaced them following their substantial reduction in the later years especially during the seventh plan period.
recording a gradual increase, the shared of finished products increased to 82.9 percent of the total export in fy 1989/90.
while jute and jute goods, rice, pulse and timber were main exportable in the initial years, the industrial finished products such as the woolen carpets and readymade garments became main exportable in the later years.
as regards the trade structure of import, the shares of foods and raw materials, industrial goods and other materials in the total import in fy 1961/62 were 39.9 percent, 59.5 percent and 0.8 percent respectively.
there was predominance of industrial goods in the total import in fy 1989/90.
the components of industrial goods and foods and industrial raw materials in the total imports in that year were 71.3 percent and 28.7 percent respectively.
some efforts of export promotion and the creation of some institutional bases over the past years helped achieve some success in countrywise diversification of export trade.
however, no real increase in export volume could be matherialised due to the lake of sustainable and sound bases through product diversification.
during the early 10 year period of the panchayat regime, there was predominance of agricultural goods such as cereals and jute in the field of export and following the gradual decline in export of these goods, the industrial goods such as woolen carpets and readymade garments occupied the prominent place in the later years.
overseas import increased considerably due to the country wise and productwise diversification of import during this review period.
while the share of import was 13.1 percent in the gross domestic product gdp in fy 1964/65, it gradually increased to 20.2 percent in fy 1989/90 the export, however, showed only an insignificant increase during the same period period.
the share of export in gdp stood at 7 percent in 1964/65, which declined to 5.7 percent only on 1989/990.
6.2 balance of payments situation the foreign trade and balance of payment situation was used to be taken in isolation till 1970.
later from 1975 onwards it was felt that the foreign trade and the balance of payments situation needed to be coordinated with other aspects relation to monetary, fiscal, foreign exchange and production of the country and due attention should be paid to the close interrelations among them while formulating the economic policy.
thus, it became the foreign trade toward a specified goal of the economy during the first decade of the panchayat regime.
thought the history if foreign trade of nepal is long, the date relating to balance of payment being available only after 1974/75, the situation analysis is possible only of the years thereafter.
the main reasons for the balance of payment to be unfa vourable to the country during these years were the reduction of total export and the excessive increase in import resulting in great trade deficit.
current account deficit increased considerably in all three years.
while balance of payment surplus had increased by 7.5 timens in 1989/90 in comparison to 1974/75, trade deficit had increased by 14.3 times.
similarly, current account deficit increased at 32 percent per annum or by 64.5 times in 1989/90 in comparison to 1974/75.
as a result, the ration of current account deficit and gdp increased intensely.
while, this ration was about 1 percent in 1974/75, it increased to 8.5 percent in 1989/90.
the main cause for this intense increase if current account deficit amount was the considerable increase in trade deficit.
there occurred an excessive flow of foreign loans to bring down balance of payment deficit to a favourable situation in the years past.
though this was a short term expedient to make up current account deficit amount, this was not a reliable and sound was out in the long run, as it was certain that the economy itseif will have to face serious consequences in the future due to the burden of the foreign debt loan.
there was a great increase in the foreign debt in the years past.
there was much pressure on balance of payments situation on account of increasing current account deficit each year due to a slow growth in income from services and transfers during this period.
foreign exchange situation the foreign exchange reserves situation was favorable on the whole during the period of july 1961 to july 1990.
this underwent a gradual change and the convertible foreign exchange began to gain predominance in july 1990.
taking into consideration the reserves of both convertible and nonconsideration currencies together, while it could meet the import for 5.8 months in fy 1960/61, it was capable of meeting 7.6 monthsâ€™ import in 1989/90.
thus, though there was a considerable increase in foreign currency reserves during this period, development of a regular and sustainable source of foreign exchange increased due to excessive flow if foreign loan and grants and as these are not reliable sources, a situation persisted where there was the possibility of drastic reduction of the reserves.
physical progress situation 1.
agriculture, forest and irrigation 1.1 agriculture much importance was attached to cereal crops production programme during the periodic plans in the past with the objective of increasing agricultural production and productivity.
considering the development of institutional infrastructures during the past period and also the priority accorded in the allocation of development expenditure to meet theabove objective, the achievements made in the agricultural sector in respect of pro duction and productivity appeared to be far from satisfactory.
during the period of 1961/62 and 1989/90, while the are3a covered by the cereal crops increased at the rate of 2.2 percent per annum, production of principal cereal crops increased at an average of 2.1 percent per annum.
the productivity, thus decreased by a rate of 0.1 percent.
it became clearly evident that the contribution of the increased area was pivotal to whatever increase took place in production growth.
similarly, the area, the production rate and the productivity rate of cash crops increased by 1.8 percent, 5.1 percent and 3.3 percent respectively over the period.
forest massive expansion of organizational structures in the forest sector was carried out in order to conserve the forest area and arrange the supply of forest products during the past period.
while forest development works in the hill and terai were being undertaken through a total of 22 forest divisions and 7 circle offices in 1965, forest offices in all the 75 districts, regional offices in all the regions and more than 200 ranger offices were set up by the year 1990.
similarly, the number of technical manpower was considerably increased during this period.
hence, though it was claimed that massive expansion of institutional bases of the forest sector and tree plantation works was undertaken during this period, the present dilapidated situation of the forest vindicates the fact that due attention was not paid towards forest conservation, promotion and utilization.
though legal frameworks were constituted for conservation, promotion and utiliisation of forest during this period, forest protection could not be undertaken in an effective manner due to weak and inefficient implementation.
the forest sector became the major source of personal income for the cunning and shrewd people.
forest determination took place intensively during this period.
this adversely affected the environment as well as the climate of the country.
according to available statistics, while the forest coverage was 6,402,000 ha. in 1964, this was reduced to 6,306,000 ha. by the end of f.y. 1985/85.
1.3 irrigation before the advent of the panchayat system, the irrigation facility was only available to 11,428 ha. of land.
it was estimated that irrigation facility was available to about 21 percent of the cultivated land by 1989/90 with the availability of additional irrigation facility to a total of 539,039 ha. of land during the panchayat regime as a result of heavy investment in the irrigation sector during this period.
though emphasis was given on the development and expansion of the irrigation sector in the past periodic plans, its implementation part could not be effective.
industry, tourism and electricity 2.
during the period of three decades, the development of industry remained at the rudimentary stage and could not gain momentum.
industrial production showed and average increase of 7 percent per annum from the analysis of the production index of 18 principal industrial products from the period 1974/75 to 1989/90.
while the production of jute goods decreased at an average of 6 percent per annum during the period, the production of agricultural tools and bricks and tiles decreased at 4.1 and 1.8 percent respectively.
similarly, there took place only a slow growth in products directly associated with the needs of the society such as cement, sugar, cotton merchandise, matches, there occurred a considerable growth in consumable products like liquor, beer, synthetic cloth, soap, shoe and biscuit.
the capacity utilization of some selected industries was about 63 percent during the period from 1975/76 to 1989/90.
the capacity utilization of jute goods and beer industries was above 70 percent.
similarly, the capacity utilization of sugar and cigarette industries was 69 and 66 percent respectively.
but the same of the cement, brick and tile and match industries remained less than 60 percent.
â while the contribution of the cottage industry to the gross domestic produce was 1.4 pecent in 1974/75, this declined to 0.7 percent in 1989/90.
the development of the cottage industry could not be oriented towards a correct direction in the past while rs. 9.6 million was invested in 1974/75 following the registration of 70 cottage and small industries, a sum of rs. 828.6 million was invested in 1989/90 with the registration of 932 cottage and small industries.
hence, the pace of development of the industrial sector was slow in the past.
the industrial policies of the past had emphasized the creation of industrial environment to increase the contribution of the industrial sector to the economy by infusing momentum into this sector.
but the flow of investment could not be channeled to industries with long term benefits due to the lack of proper implementation mechanism, procedural constraints and administrative delay.
due to the distortions arising out of industrial protectionism there could not be created a favourable environment for increasing the investment in nationally imoortant industries related to production, employment and income distribution.
the large investment of the private sector in industry was greatly attracted to the activities yielding quick and easy return.
there were no incentives to attract investment towards industries directly associated with the need of the society.
due to this, forward and backward linkages of the economy with other sectors could not be developed.
the government policy instead of being incentive oriented was control oriented to attract the foreign investment.
on the whole, the government policy could neither act as a catalyst nor contribute in leading the country towards industrialization.
2 tourism while 7,750 tourists came to nepal in f.y. 1961/62, this number reached 246, 361 in 1989/90 with its average annual growth rate of 13.1 percent.
while in the beginning the kathmandu valley alone was the centre of attraction, a substantial increase in the number of tourists took place during this period due to the extension of trekking, mountaineering, national parks and other places of touristic attraftion outside the valley.
despite the increase in the number of tourists during this period, no increase in average stay and expenses incurred per day materialized for the lack of proper development and expansion of infrastructures and places of tourist attraction.
while the average stay of a tourist was 13.1 days in 1974/75, this went down to 12 days in 1989/90.
similarly, while each tourist during his stay in nepal spent  24.00 in 1961/62, the level of expenditure remained unchanged in 1989/90.
substantial foreign exchange was earned from the tourist sector during the period from 1961/62 to 1989/90.
while the earning from the tourist sector was merely us 78,000.00 in 1961/62, us 68,343,000,00 was earned in 1989/90 with an average increase of 26 percent per annum.
2.3 electricity upto 1960, the total generation capacity of electric power in the country was 7.03 mw. out of this, 2.077 mw. was generated from the hydropower stations and 4.953 mw. from the diesel plants.
in the period between 1961/62 and 1989/90, some other small projects and big hydroelectric projects such as the panauti, trishuli, sunkosi, devighat, gandak, kulekhani and marsyangdi were commissioned.
by the end of 1989/90, the total generation capacity including hydro and diesel in the country was 227.084 mw. while about 1 percent of the total population had access to electricity in 1960/61, 8.8 percent of the population could enjoy this facility by the end of 1989/90.
thus, though electricity generation and distribution was increased, the burden arising from the excessive per unit cost of electricity due to completed projects being very expensive fell upon the consumers.
transport and communication 3.1 transport a.
roads prior to 1950, the facility of motorable road in the country was almost nonexistent.
a review of the situation shows that the road available all over the kingdom in 1960/61 was 1198 km., out of which 339km. was metalled and 859 km. fair weather road.
upto the end of fy 1989/90, 7,330 km. of road facility was available in the country out of which 2,958km. was black topped, 1,658km. graveled and 2,714 km. fair weather road.
while looking at the roadpopulation ratio, every kilometer of road had served a population averaging 7,780 people in 1960, upon the reduction of this ration on 1989/90, every kilometer served a population of 2441.
in addition to these, some efforts have also been made in the construction of suspension bridge, wooden bridges, foot trail, mule track and service tra ck etc. which constrtute the minimum basic needs for the development of the rural areas.
thus, in spite of the efforts mad for the development of road transport, several of the district headquarters od not have access to road.
the construction of roads co uld not be completed as required nor could the economy derive maximum benefits from the constructed roads because of the excessive increase in the cost of road construction and the lack of timely repair and maintenance.
air transport prior to 1960ad, the country had a total of 12 airfields with 1 metalled and 11 fair weather type.
necessary physical facilities and communication services complementary to aviation were unavailable in several airfields.
in fy 1974/75 there was a total of 28 air fields, all over the kingdom with 4 metalled, 12 fair eather and 12 small airstrips.
by 1989/90 the number of total air fields reached 43.
the internal air service has been operated by royal nepal airlines corporation.
in 1960/61, this corporation had initiated its service with 6 aeroplanes.
in fy 1989/90, this corporation had 24 aeroplanes and it operated its services internally is 36 places and externally in 10 cities.
long before 1960, railways and ropeways were established in nepal.
till fy 1960/61 nepal had 99 km. of narrow gauge railway and 23km. long ropeway linking hetauda and kathmandu with a capacity to carry 25 tons of material per hour was constructed and service of trolley bus between kathmandu and bhaktapur covering a distance of 13 km. was brought into operation.
thus, no specific progress was achieved in the development of other types of transport during this period.
as far as the railway transport is concerned, the progress was absolutely nil.
3.2 communication a.
postal services till fy 1960/61, the total number of post offices all over the country was 409.
it was estimated that a post office at an average had provided service to 22,252 people within an area of 132 square miles.
in fy 1974/75, the country had 1,006 post offices.
out of these, there were one general post office, 74 district post offices, 254 subpost offices and 678 additional post offices.
in fy 1989/90, nepal had a total of 2,231 post offices.
thus in 1989/90 each post office provided service to 8100 people within an area of 66 sq.km. b.
populationtelephone ratio in nepal reached 2501 with the availability of the service of 71,560 telephone lines in fy 1989/90.
in reality, the people could rarely get true and real messages through the newspaper etc. in spite of the fact that freedom to newspapers etc. plan with the motto of national communication plan with the motto of â€œcommunication for dev elopmentâ€� was launched in 1971.
the communication sector was in fact stagnated as the media of communication were within the government control.
the nepal television has started operation its service since 1985.
social services 4.1.
education the country made some progress in the field of education in the past.
but that progress was merely limited to quantitative increase.
while teacherstudent ration was 125 at the primary class class 1 3 level in 1961, it increased to 139 by april 1990.
similarly, the schoolstudent ration of 146 in 1961, recorded a significant increase to 1156 by april 1990.
hence, a situation arose, where sufficient number of schools could not be increased in comparison to the increase in the number of students.
out of the total students of the primary class of the age group 6 to 10, 182,533 had attended their classes in 1961 and this work out to be 14.4 percent of that age group.
against this, 2,789,000 students attended classes by april 1990 and this works out to be 80 percent of that age group.
â similarly, at the secondary school level, the number of schools increased from 156 in 1961 to 1959 in april 1990, the number of teachers from 1,772 to 10,421 and the number of students from 26,845 to 264,525.
hence, the schoolstudent ration of 1961 increased from 1172 to 1187 by april 1990 and similarly, the teacherstudent ration changed from 115 to 135.
in the field of higher education, while the number of students in 1961 was 5,143, this increased to 102,130 in fy 1989/90.
development requirements of the country could not be met in spite of this quantitiative increase in the educational sector.
it was believed that the system would be instrumental to fulfil the national objective of education towards preparation of neces sary manpower for economic development with the dissemination of requisite knowledge, science, development, conservation and promotion of technical expertise and skill.
in the process if implementing this system, the budget was increased 5 to 6 times in the districts where the education plan had been introduced the schools run with the public participation were brought under the government employees on the name of making the teaching profession attractive, a ten month mandatory field work under the national development service porgramme was introduced sixteen institutes and campuses were established by bringing about fundamental changes in the administrative set up of teaching institutions providing higher education.
the country could not make qualitative advance in the field of education as a result of the new education system instead, there was further deteoriation.
no academic changes evolved in the attitudinal perspective of the students an teachers, unsustainable financial burden increased on the educational sector and public participation was almost obliterated.
useful programmes such as the national development service programmes were put off for political reasons.
the national education was proved to be ineffective and inappropriate on account of all these reasons.
while population per hospital bed was 9,146 in 1961, this was 3915 in 1990.
thus, each doctor had to provide service to 14,958 people in 1990.
while the average life span of a nepali citizen was 28 years in 1961, this increased to 53 by fy 1989/90.
family planning programme was launched as a national programme only from fy 1965/66 through the government and non government associations and institutions while maternity child health programe was initiated around fy 1973/74 only.
afterwares, family planning and maternity child health projects were implemented in all the 75 districts if the kingdom.
4.3 drinking water attention was given towards providing drinking water facility right from the beginning of planned development.
drinking water programmes had been initiated especially in urban areas and some rural areas prior to 1960.
by 1961 1,452,000 gallons of water per day was available to 6 percent of the population.
in 1989/90, only 36 percent of the total population had drinking water facility with 67 percent and 33 percent of the urban and rural areas respectively having access to this facility.
accordingly, the available statistics shows that 5,424, 000 and 1,134,000 residents of the rural and urban areas respectively had access to the drinking water facility.
thus, majority of the people in the country are as yet deprived from an access to hygienic supply of water in spite of the fact that expansion of drinking water facility had taken place in the past.
the water that was provided was also not available in required quantities.
on the one hand, there was a lack of hygienic supply of water, and on the other, there was plenty of leakage in the drinking water.
in addition to this, it is estimated that 70 percent of the diseases are caused by the polluted water.
â conclusions viewed in the total perspective, in spite of massive investments made in the past, nepal still remains one of the poorest nations of the world.
although some progress was made in social and physical infrastructural sectors, the progres s appeared remarkable only in comparison to the negligible figures of the base year.
in the absence of any political opposition, there did exist the opportunity of channeling the autocration character of panchayat to rapid economic development but, unfortunately, this also did not mathrialise.
the lack of structural change in production hindered the development process from gaining momentum.
a low savings rate, the increased share of loan in forging assistance, low level of industrialization, weak agricultural production, limited export trade and a high population growth rate remained as barriers in the path of development.
they economy had to face serious problems due to imbalance between resource mobilisation and expenditure, imbalance between savings and investments and between export and import and the lack of control over population growth.
during the three decades of the panchayat regime, there was never a dearth of attractive fundamental reform programmes and slogans.
however, these programmes were confined to mere slogans due to the lack of political commitment.
some of the functions whose initiation was attempted at conceptual and operational levels by the elected demarcation government in 1959 for fundamental changes in economic structure were given political colour and introduced as fundamental economic reform movements.
notwithstanding the fact that without peopleâ€™s faith and commitment no planned development can manifest into meaningful reality and nor can any sustainable change oriented to peopleâ€™s welfare be brought about in the economic structure, a revolutionary economic programme of land reform was introduced in the very beginning of the panchayat regime.
land reform was, in fact, an essential programme in a feudalistic rural society, but the inability to prepare accurate land records, lack of the guarantee of tenancy right, the existence of dual or multi ownership of land, inability to provide land for shelter and subsistence income, failure to keep prcords and make proper utilization of the collected savings, lack of diversification in crop farming and cottage industries in the rural sector and, above al, the lack of desirable growth in production and productivity during the thirty years if the panchayat regime have clearly evidenced the failure if lad reform.
instead, as a longterm consequence, there emerged a situation after land reform where nepal, a major food exporter of south asia, turned into an importer of food grains and the situation accelerated the process if migration, too.
a national campaign entitled â€˜back to the villageâ€™ was initiated with a view to providing a village oriented philosophical base to the panchayat regime.
it was indeed a prerequisite for rural development.
however, while it was predestined that there would be no going â€˜back to the villageâ€™ without the decentralization of power, the construction of infrastructure for rural development and the creation of employment opportunities, this genuine movement instead if being utilized in development programmes was developed into a system of political evaluation of panchayat workers and a means of orienting them towards position of pow3er.
this movement experienced a misfortune when it turned into a process of the selection of workers, replacing the election system, masquerading as unanimity.
the people were despaired of their aspirations, enthusiasm and zeal to participate in development efforts by this process, which thus created a setback to local development.
it was, indeed, not at all inappropriate on a conceptual le vel to create a basis for balanced regional development through the formation of development regions based on a realistic delineation of a northsouth growth axis or development corridors.
however, no efforts were made towards developing a systematic settlement of the population along the growth or development corridors in desirable proportions and there were not launched, as required, any socioeconomic programmes based on available local means and resources and focusing on the generation of employment opportunities either.
consequently, a system developed in which the center controlled the mechanism of regional development, which accorded a decisive role to the central development region creating an influx of a large population to it and making it the operationsite for the greatest number of development programmes.
the construction of the eastwest highway which was initiated in the panchayat regime was a multidimensional project for national development.
however, the construction of this highways designed to link the remote, â inaccessible far western region could not be completed even within the stretch of thirty years.
nevertheless, it cannot be denied that whatever sectors were completed, did contribute to linking the socioeconomic activities of the road corridors to the marketoriented economy.
moreover, since the immediate as well as longterm effects of a project of such a great magnitude were not take into full consideration, the terai region has now had to bear the brunt of the natural as well as ma nmade disasters like drought and floods due to excessive migration, haphazard human settlements and the degradation of the churiya region and the charkoshe jhari the forest belt of the terai, once acclaimed as the treasure house of forest resources.
the rehabilitation of the environment in terms of the magnitude of degradation that has occurred has become a momentous task for a century.
enlisting panchayat as a third sector in the periodic plans of the panchayat regime, statistical projections were made with regard to peopleâ€™s labours contribution.
peopleâ€™s participation undoubtedly deserved a significant role in the decision making process but the periodic plant and the ever decreasing percentage of peopleâ€™s labour contribution in the panchayat sector clearly demonstrated the fact that the so called peopleâ€™s labour contribution was a mandatory obligation imposed on people for the programmes decided upon for them by others.
thus, the essential and effective prerequisites for national development, peopleâ€™s participation and peopleâ€™s labour contribution, could not be utilized for sustainable development orientated to peopleâ€™s welfare.
during the panchayat regime, programmes were implemented with greater emphasis on the task of preserving the system than on national development.
a new education plan was introduced in the form of a national education system, which in reality created a havoc in the education sector.
many commissions were constituted and studies conducted on the issue of the decentralization of power.
the fact that efficient, autonomous local bodies are the cornerstone of a democratic system and can, uphold the responsibility of local development through peopleâ€™s participation was ignored.
with a view to projecting panchayat as a democration system, some efforts were made with regard to decentralization but there occurred centralization with several instances of retrieval of the decentralized authority.
in the first place, the power entrusted to local bodies were not of permanent nature as the bodies themselves were liable to be dismissed at any time at the discretion of the government.
wile for the lack of decentralization in real terms, many projects aimed at integrated rural development with international assistance could not deliver meaningful results, many projects, as the studies have revealed, created a negative outlook towards development at the local level.
a programme to control the increasing population was indeed indispensable.
a population policy was formulated for this purpose.
it included some basic activities such as the reduction of birth rate, control of immigration, control of migration from hills to the terai and from villages to urban areas and maternal child health care.
however, while the immigration problem remained unchanged due to the inability to restore cordial relations with the neighbouring country with an open border and the failure to recognize the problem in an international perspective, the other aspects of population control ended in failure for the lack of complementary programmes.
in consequence, there arose impediments to urban development, the social service infrastructures became insufficient, unemployment increased, the environment deteriorated, pollution prevailed and in the long run, the adverse impact in the economy as a whole was evidently perceptible to all.
although in the three periodic plans of the panchayat regime preference was accorded to agricultural sector for intensification and diversification in crops through reforms in the farming system of this country composed of hamlets and villages, the wide gulf between planning and implementation always led to a negative result.
while it called for liberal economic policies and the creation of an atmosphere conducive to industrialists with some reassurances in certain spheres for achieving industrial expansion, the industries could not prosper in the absence of transparency in industrial policy which remained under strict government control.
even those industries which had begun their operation could not flourish for not being able to acquire self reliance.
the â€˜basic needsâ€™ programme announced in dec./jan/ 1985 became the principal slogan and priority of the seventh plan.
this programme took a vow to fulfil the basic minimum needs such as foodgrains, clothing, housing, health, education and public security among others and raise the economic condition of the people to the asian standard by 2000.
because of the dynamic nature of the asian standard, the term was eventually deleted from the slogan.
the basic needs programme had adopted a supply oriented approach in its formulation paying no attention to the purchasing power of the proposed consumers.
without any resource mobilisation for physical and institutional development, production targets, unthinkable in a historical perspective, were set for the fulfillment of the needs.
in consequence of the distorted ad hoc economic policies of thirty years interspersed with hollow slogans of disappointing development resumts and programmes without achievements, the country had to bear several economic distortions which were as follows.
excessive control and regulation the controloriented development approach of the past created many problems.
increased government control, adhoc regulations and procedures, license requirements and other forms of counterproductive bureaucratic behaviour tended to discourage decision making process and delays in the disbursement of budgets increased project implementation costs and resulted in the under utilization of the administrative capacity.
â inefficient public enterprises the performance of state owned enterprises reached a stage of great inefficiency, indifference and apathy.
these enterprises suffered as a result of over staffing, political intervention, inefficiency and the lack of accountability.
inefficient investment portfolio costbenefit rations, and other criteria criteria which measure the economic and social benefits of projects were neglected in the coruse of selecting projects to be implemented in various sectors and subsectors.
the interrelationships among projects and alternative investment options were not takes into consideration.
as a result, investment could not be channeled to productive sectors.
many projects were not justifiable from economic and social points of vies.
high cost economy in view of the inaccessibility and the ruggedness of terrain it is not unusual for the production and delivery costs to be high.
but in addition to these realities, the cost component of the economy has been further aggravated by the dominance of donor driven projects, economically unproductive investments, lack of discipline, limited economic resources of projects, unwarranted expansion of bureaucracy and lack of efficient implementation capabilities.
inefficient administration inefficiency in the administration has led to a further deterioration in the governmentâ€™s institutional abilities to effectively implement development programmes.
political decisions were often autocratic and feudalistic.
as a result, the planning process lacked accountability and was unable to induce genuine popular participation.
policy changes and achievements during 1990 1992 the main responsibility of the interim government formed after the restoration of the multiparty system through the historic peopleâ€™s movement of 1990 against the panchayat regime was to concentrate on two things 1.
to formulate constitution compatible with the norms and values of multiparty democratic system.
to hold general elections in accordance with the constitution.
as it was incumbent upon the interim gov ernment to fulfil these two functions within a short period on a priority basis, the task of formulating a periodic plan was postponed for the time being.
subsequent to the formation of the imterim government, an understanding with india in may 1990 ended the trade impasse with india which had begun on march 23, 1989, reinstating the status quo ante in relationship with india.
this understanding with india had a positive impact the year on the countryâ€™s economic activities.
the government established a citizenâ€™s investment fund, introduced wealth tax and made efforts to redue the budgetary deficit.
similarly, policies were adopted to increase the role of the private sector in agriculture and to offer additional incentives to lowincome farming families in the course of providing loans.
â following the formation of the nepali congress government with a clean mandate in the general elections held in may 1991, the national planning commission in the course of formulation the eighth plan brought out for circulation and approach paper of the plan.
the government formed through general elections started taking some major steps to remove the distortions in the countryâ€™s economic and administrative structure.
initially, the present government took steps to transform the controlled economy of the past thirty years into an open, liberal, transparent and competive market oriented economy.
the approach to the eighth plan was prepared accordingly.
similarly, with the objective of achieving full convertibility if the nepalese currency in current account, a partial convertibility system was introduced.
necessary procedures have also been initiated to privatize five agricultural farms in government sector.
with a view to strengthening the internal air service, permission was granted to private sector to operate domestic flights.
as a result, three private sector airlines have begun their domestic flight operation within one year.
liberal policies aimed at attracting more tourists have also been adopted to encourage the services of foreign airlines.
with the objectives of attracting foreign investors, a new foreign investment policy was formulated.
to promote export, arrangements have been made for free export of all commodities without licence requirements except for a few senstitive items.
similarly, a policy was introduced to gradually phase out the quantitative restrictions on imports and adjust them through customs tariff.
changes were made in financial rules to minimize control and intervention and expedite plan implementation.
according to these new rules, project chiefs are authorized to senction estimated expenditures if upto 5 million rupees, to approve tenders of upto 20 million rupees and to modify upto 10 percent of total expenditure on technical grounds.
accordingly, the district development committee act 1992, the municipality act 1992 and the village development committee act, 1992 have been formulated and implemented.
at the same time, the election of local bodies was also completed.
the local election has thus successfully laid down the foundation for a democratic system and the local bodies have now initiated the tradition of playing an important role in development activities in consonance with the policy of decentralization.
furthermore, the foreign exchange reform was another significant step undertaken during this period.
partial convertibility in foreign exchange was introducted in february 1992.
under this arrangement, the banks conducting business in foreign currency were allowed to sell 65 percent of their earnings from trade or services at the open market exchange rate by making available 35 percent of the foreign currency earning to nepal rastra bank at a rate fixed by the bank.
during the same period, the agreement reached with india on trade, transit and the control of unauthorized trade removed the feeling of instability prevalent in the trade sector.
the new agreement incorporates significant provisions such as mutual understanding to be reached on the issue of the exemption of indian tax on the export of primary goods from nepal, the reduction of the mandatory constituent percentage of indigenous raw materials from 80 percent to 65 percent in the manufactured products of nepal, the reduction of internal value added from 50 percent to 40 percent and so on.
with the objective of providing direct benefits to the low income people, a policy was adopted granting one third interest subside on the current interest rates in a lloan of upto rs. 10,000 under the small farmers development project, intensive banking programme, and rural women development programme.
similarly, another policy allowed a 80 percent interest waiver at prevalent rates of interest to the economically deprived sections in the rural area for income generating employment activities on a loan of upto rs. 2,500 procured for the spinning wheel and wool for carpet industry, handichafts, smallscale mills, small farming enterprises etc.
as a part of the alternative energy development programme, rural electrification was initiated.
a provision to offer a capital of rs. 7,000 was made to make the biogas plants accessible to rural families.
these steps will make important contribution in alleviating poverty in rural areas.
in order to effectively and appropriately implement the above mentioned policies, it is necessary to increase the workefficiency of the government administrative machinery and to achieve the active participation of the private sector.
the government has accordingly constituted a high level administration reform commission and a process has been initiated for the implementation of the commissionâ€™s recommendationsâ€™.
similarly, a commission was formed to undertake a detailed study of the civil servantsâ€™ pay scales and make necessary recommendations in order to raise the moral of the civil servants and increase their workperformance.
the government also raised the salary in accordance with the recommendations of the commission.
gross domestic product a revised estimate indicates that the per capita income in 1990/91 reached rs. 1736 at 1974/75 constant prices.
similarly, according to a preliminary estimate, the per capita gdp is expected to increase only by 1 percent in 1991/92.
therefore, the per capita income has increased marginally and estimated to have reached rs 1754.
only a marginal increase in per capita income in 1991/92 can be mainly attributed to the decline in agriculture production.
in the period of 1989/901991/92, the gross domestic product went up by 4.3 percent with the growth of 1.6 percent in agricultural sector and 8.4 percent in nonagricultural sector.
in the fiscal year f.y. 1990/91 at f.y. 1974.75 constant prices, the shares of an agricultural and non agricultural sectors in gross domestic product were respectively 59.4 percent and 42.1 percent, which are expected to be 57.9 percent and 42.1 percent respectively in f.y. 1991/92.
the main contributing factors for theis can be attributed to the various efforts of the government for the development of the nonagricultural sectors.
during the f.y. 1989/901991/92 period, the major crops recorded an increase of 0.1 percent wit h a decline of 0.7 percent in the production indices of major food crops and a 3.6 percent increase in cash crops.
in that period, while the production of most of the crops increased, paddy, oil seeds and tobacco recorded a slight decrease.
according to the new classification of industrial products, it is estimated that the production of food products, beverages, textile, tobacco products, shoes, plastic goods, the products of iron and steel based industries have increased during the period under review.
further acceleration in industrial production is expected as a result of the new industrial policy.
investment and savings in fiscal year 1990/91, gross investment is estimated to have increased at a rate of approximately 28.4 percent to rs. 21,163 million, which stands at 20.1 percent of gross domestic product.
similarly, the gross domestic savings is estimated to have reached rs. 6864 million with an increase of 23.4 percent in 1990/91.
this is merly 6.5 percent of gross domestic product.
it is estimated that the total consumption in fiscal year 1990/91 increased by 15.4 percent amounting to rs. 94,836 millions.
thus, investme ntsavings ration declined from 33.7 percent in 1989/90 to 32.4 percent in that fiscal year.
government financial situation 3.1 development expenditure the total development expenditure stood at rs. 15,979.5 million at current prices in the fiscal year 1990/91.
in 1991/92, the development expenditure is expected to decrease, according to the revised estimate, by 6.5 percent to reach rs. 14945.7 million.
at constant prices, the total development expenditure in fiscal years 1990/91 and 1991/92 is es timated to be rs. 2997.5 and rs. 2320.8 million respectively.
revenue surplus it is estimated that total revenue will increase by 19.7 precent at current prices and 3.9 percent at constant prices in 1989/901991/92 period.
if the revenue grows at this rate, the total revenue will reach 10.2 percent at current prices and 6.2 percent at constant prices of the gross domestic product.
during this period, regular expenditure will, according to the estimate, grow by 20.1 percent at current prices and 4.3 percent at constant prices.
viewed in terms of the share in gross domestic product, the regular expenditure in 1990/91 and 1991/92 stands respectively at 7.2 and 7.4 percent at current prices and 4.4 and 4.5 percent at constant prices.
despite the continued efforts to increase revenue and control regular expenditure, there was no marked increade in the revenue surplus because of a low collection of taxes particularly in 1990.91 and the pressure of the increased salary of civil servants on regular expenditure especially in the latter months of 1991/92.
the share of revenue surplus on gross domestic product remained at current prices at 3.0 percent in 1990/91 and 2.8 percent in 1991/92.
at constant prices the figures thus stood at 1.8 percent and 1.7 percent respectively.
deficit finance during the period under review, as the targeted growth in revenue was not achieved, concerted efforts were made towards controlling the mobilisation of deficit finance in the economy and remarkable progress was made in this regard.
the shard of deficit fincance is expected, especially in 1990/91, to be 1.0 percent at current prices and 0.6 percent of gdp at constant prices, and thus the share of the same in internal resource mobilisation is estimated to be only 22.1 percent.
foreign assistance as a result of the steps taken by the government towards eliminating the level of disparity between foreign aid commitments and their utilization, the committed foreign aid during 1990.91 is expected to have been fully utilized nearly to the extent of hundred percent.
the utilized amount appears to have exceeded the aid commitments because of the inclusion of unused amount of previous years.
in view of the heavy reliance on foreign assistance in the past, it was not possible to drastically reduce this dependence.
furthermore, as various projects at different stages of implementation are being funded by foreign aid and as their closure would not only entail a wastage of foreign aid in development expenditure and the share of loan in total foreign aid are estimated to be more or less equivalent to those in 1989/90.
monetary and credit situation the principal objective of the monetary policy of the period under revied was to regulate the rate of money supply at a level sustainable at the actual growth rate of national production and the national economy, to strengthen the financial base by introducing reforms in the financial sector, to make the bank interest rates more realistic by enhancing the efficacy of indirect monetary control measures and the economically deprived people and in the priority sectors.
the money supply level increased at the rate of 17.6 percent from mid july 1989 to mid july 1991, as a result of which the money supply level which stood at rs. 11,775.4 million in mid july 1989 reached rs. 16,283.6 million in mid july 1991.
during that period, the currency increased by 21.2 percent ad the current deposit by 9.9 percent.
the net forging assets increased form rs. 6203.5 million in mid july 1989 to rs. 16,150.7 million in mid july 1991.
the domestic credit went up by 130.9 percent during that period.
similarly, by mid july 1991, thee government sector had received rs, 7,373.1 million out of the total bank credit and investment disbursement of rs. 24,410.5 millions.
however, the public sector undertakings appeared to have received less bank credit disbursement in mid july 1991.
n the other hand, loands to the private sector gradually increased.
reached rs. 15026.8 million in 1991.
price situation during the period 1989/90 and 19991/92, the urban consumer price index went up by 15.2 percent experiencing a growth prate of 16.8 percent in food and beverage products and 12.1 percent in nonfood product and services.
the major reason behind the 15.2 percent growth was the increase in overall index by 20.8 percent in 1991/92.
the immense growth in nonfood products and services accompanied by the increas e in food and beverage products in 1991/92 caused the price level reach extremely high during this period.
however, both internal and external factors were responsible for this high price rise.
at the internal front, the major factors were the reduction in the production of food crops because of adverse weather conditions, the devaluation of the nepalese currency in comparison to convertible foreign currencies leading to the increase in pricen of raw materials and foreign goods imported from third countries, the immense price rise in indian imports owing to the decline in the production of food ad other products as a consequence of adverse weather conditions and the excessive liquidity in the economy.
similarly, the external factors consisted of the increas e in the rates of foreign exchange and the inflation in indian market etc. 6.
foreign trade and balance of payments situation 6.1 foreign trade as a result of the trade impasse with india, the share of the trade with india in total foreign trade was only 22.7 percent in 1989/90, which increased to 28.5 percent in 1991/92 following the improvement in nepalindia relations subsequent to the peopleâ€™s movement of 1990.
the export, which stood at rs. 7,503/7 million in 1990/91, increased to rs. 13,939.4 million in 1991/92.
out of the total export, the export to india was rs. 1,701.2 million in 1990/91 and reached to rs. 1,568.9 million in 1991/92.
on the import front, the fiscal year 1990/91 recorded the total import of rs. 24,197.9 million, which reached rs. 32,951.3 million in fiscal year 1991/92.
the import from india which stood at rs. 7,772.4 million in 1990/91 increased to rs. 11,815.9 million in 1991/92.
similarly, imports from other countries increased to rs. 21,135.4 million in 1991/92 from rs. 16,425.5 millions in 1990/91.
thus, the total trade deficit, which was rs. 16,594.2 million in 1990/91, increased to rs. 19,011.9 million in 1991/92.
in 1990/91, while the trad deficit with india was rs. 6,071.2 million, with other countries ot stood at rs. 10,523 million.
similarly, the deficit with india and other countries in 1991/92 stood at rs. 10,247 million and rs. 8,764.9 million respectively.
thus, the trade deficit which increased by 26.0 percent in 1990/92 declined to 14.6 percent in 1991/92.
in view of the trade composition of the country, the industrial goods have, in comparison with food products and raw materials, started gaining dominant share in the countryâ€™s export.
the share of food products and raw materials in the total export was 21.9 percent in fiscal year 1990/91 and 19.4 percent in fiscal year 1991/92.
the increased predominance of the industrial goods in the import trade composition in fiscal year 1990/91 continued to the subsequent year of 1991/92, too.
the share of food products and raw materials in total import was 30.9 percent in f.y. 1990/91, which increased slightly to 3.6 perc ent in f.y 1991/92.
thus, the share of industrial goods slightly declined from 69.1 percent in f.y. 1990/91 to 63.4 percent on f.y. 1991/92.
6.2 balance of payments situation although the balance of payments situation appeared favourable during f.y. 1990/91, the current account deficit was noticed to have increased considerably.
while the current account had increased to rs. 10,254.9 million in f.y. 1990/91, it reduced to rs. 9,578.1 in f.y. 1991/92.
the principal reason behind the fall in current account deficit was the slackness experienced in the increase of trade deficit.
during these years also, foreign grants and loans played a major role in maintaining a favourable balance of payments situation.
yet, compared to historical growth rate 1974/751989/90, it is on the decline.
for instance, while the trade deficit increased by 19.4 percent as current account by 32.0 percent in 1974/75â€“1989/90, they recorded average annual growth rates of 14.5 percent and 11.5 percent respectively during the period 1989/901991/92.
while in 1990/91 the balance of payment surplus was rs. 4,781.2 million, the surplus reached rs. 4,306.6 million in the first eleven months of 1991/92.
thus, as a result of the increased flow of external loans and capital and capital and miscellaneous capital net, there has been an increase in the balance of payments surplus this year also in spite of the considerable increase in trade deficit and current account deficit.
foreign exchange situation the policy of partial convertibility in foreign exchange was adopted since 4th march 1992.
following its introduction, the commercial banks have begun foreign exchange transactions at open market exchange rate for payments to these sectors.
the foreign exchange reserve which stood at an amount equivalent to rs. 11,984.6 million in mid july, 1990, increased to rs. 19,270 million in mid july, 1991.
thus, while the foreign exchange reserve in mid july, 1990, was just sufficient to cover 7.6 months of imports, the reserve grew sufficiently to cover 9.9 months of imports by mid july 1991.
agriculture, forest and irrigation 1.1 agriculture during the period from f.y. 1989/90 to f.y. 1991/92, the major food crops recorded a decline of 2.2 percent in production and 0.7 percent in cultivation area.
during the same period the productivity of food crops declined by 1.5 percent.
major cash crops increased during the same period by 9.9 percent in production and 1.5 percent in area.
the rate of productivity went up by 7.9 percent.
as regards the sale and distribution of production inputs in f.y. 1990/91, 72,719 metric tons of chemical fertilizers and 2,325 metric tons of seeds were sold.
at the same time, agricultural credit disbursed during that period amounted to rs. 1095.3 million.
similarly, agricultural credit to the tune of rs. 1,220.2 million is expected to have been made available.
1.2 forest in forestry development, while tree plantation was carried out in 8,956 hechtares in f.y. 1990/91, it was, carried out in 11,794 hectares in f.y. 1991/92.
in the soil conservation and watershed management sector, 29 gulley control, 24 landslide control, terracerehabilitation work in 92 hectares and protection of 43 water sources were accomplished and 283 tons pf medicinal herbs were processed.
similarly, in 1991.92 it was expected to accomplish tree plantation for soil conservation in 740 hectares, control of 34 gulleys, 83 numbers of landslide control activities, terrace rehabilitation in 239 hectares and protection of 61 water sources.
during the same period, 204 m. tons of medicinal herbs also is expected to have been processed.
1.3 irrigation while the irrigation facility was available to additional 20,810 hectares only in 1990/91, it is estimated to have been extended to an additional area of 27,527 hectares.
thus the total irrigated land is estimated to have reached 598,804 hectares, which forms 22.84 percent of the total cultivable land.
industry, tourism and electricity 2.
1 industry the industrial production index increased by 29 percent 1986/87100 in the fiscal year 1990/91.
the main reason behind the higher growth in industrial production that year can be attributed to the convenient supply of industrial raw materials following the end of the trade and transit impasse between nepal and india in may 1990.
in that fiscal year the capacity utilization in sugar, cement, brick and tiles and jute sect ors recorded an increase.
the industrial production is estimated to have risen by 15.7 percent in f.y. 1991/92.
it is estimated that is this year there has been an increase in the production of animal feed, cotton cloth, jute goods, powder soap, cement, beer, battery, plastic and jute items.
during these years, the share of small and cottage industries in gross domestic product remained around 1 percent.
while there was an investment of about rs. 1,723.4 million in cottage and small industries registered within the first nine months of f.y. 1990/91, it was estimated the in f.y. 1991/92 there would be an investment of about rs. 1,801.4 millions on 4708 industries registering within the first nine months.
2.2 tourism new trekking routes were opened in mustang and manang regions in the two 1990/91 and 1991/92 fiscal years.
permission was granted within this period to three private companied to operate air services and to one to operate companies to operate air services and to one to operate helicopter service.
in respect of the extension of airport facilities, the installation of terminal tower equipment was completed in tribhuvan international airport and at nepalgunj, dhangarhi, surkhet, simra and rumjatar air fields.
the number of foreign tourist arrival which stood at 279,747 in f.y. 1990/91 increased by 7.8 percent to 301, 496 in f.y. 1991/92.
while the foreign currency earning in 1990/91 was equivalent to us dollar 56.9 millions, it reached us dollar 62.1 million, going up by 9 percent in 1991/92.
2.3.
transport and communication 3.
out of this, 107kms.
are blacktopped, 103 kms. graveled and 371 kms. fair weather roads.
air transport by 1990/91 and 1991/92 there were, including tribhuvan international airport, 43 air fields in the country of different capacities, serving 1 jet plane, 8 avro air planes, 30 twin otters and 4 pilatus porter.
3.2 communication a.
postal services by the fiscal year 1990/91, there were all together 2231 post offices consisting of 1 general post office, 74 district post offices, 477 area post offices and 1676 additional post offices.
the figure increased to 2271 post offices by the end of f.y. 1991/92.
thus, by the end of f.y. 1991/92, one post office served 8146 people in an area of 65 sq. kms. b.
telecommunication service a total of 57,320 telephone lines were distributed in 38 urban areas by mid january 1991, with one line serving 3200 people.
the telephone line and population ration stood at 1290 by january 1991 with the distribution of 65,298 telephone lines in 38 urban areas.
while std and isd facilities were available at 62 places on 50 districts until january 1991, these service were made available at 69 places in 55 districts by january 1992.
similarly, the number of countries with isd telephone connection increased from 38 in january 1991 to 50 in january 1992.
social services 4.1 education in primary education, the student enrolment reached 2, 788, 644, the number of schools 17,842 and the number of teachers 71,213 by mid april, 1990, which established the schoolstudent ration at 1156 and the teacherstudents, schools and teachers increased respectively to 2,926,000 18,681 and 74,849 giving rise to 1157 schoolstudent ration and still 139 teacherstudent ratio.
in lowersecondary education, the student enrolment figure being 344,138, the number of schools 3,964 and the number of teachers 74,849, the schoolstudent ratio remained at 187 and teacherstudent ration at 128 by mid april 1990.
the schoolstudent ration and the teacherstudent ration reached 198 and 129, as the numbers of enrolled students, school and teacher increased to 381,000, 4,092 and 13,207 respectively by mid april 1991.
similarly, in order to reduce the student enrolment pressure on existing campuses and provide joboriented education to students, a 12class higher secondary education 102 programme was initiated.
4.2 health by the fiscal year 1991/92, the number of hospitals reached 111, health posts 816, health centres 18 and ayurved hospitals 155 and during the same period the number of doctors and women health volunteers nurses stood at 1,182 and 24,000 respectively.
thus, the doctorpartient ration and the hospital bed population ration reached 115, 800 and 13,967 respectively.
at present, the average lifeexpectancy of the nepalese people is estimated to have reached 54 years.
infant mortality rate stands 102, child death rate at 165, the crude birth rate at 39.60 and crude death rate at 14 per thousand respectively.
4.3 drinking water it is estimated that by the end of f.y. 1990/91, 5,878,000 people in the rural areas and 1,163,000 people in the urban areas, a total of 7,041,000 people had access to drinking water facilities.
out of this figure, it was in 1990/91 alone that the drinking water facility was provided to 482,899 people.
thus, according to an estimate, by the end of f.y. 1991/92, 6,699,000 people 39 percent in the rural sector and 1,172,000 people in the urban areas 66 percent, a total of 7,871,000 people would have has access to drinking water facilities.
â challenges as a result of the controlled and protectionoriented policies of the past, the economy could not achieve desired level of development and economic distortions emerged.
this led to anomalies in the allocation of resources.
in the absence of a competitive atmosphere, attention was not paid towards increasing efficiency.
therefore, no satisfactory achievement could be made in the economic sector.
this gave was to increasing poverty problem.
the impact of this situation was evidently felt in the last two years, as well.
during the past two years, there was instability in agricultural production.
as a result of the continuing heavy dependence of gross domestic production on water conditions, the trends of annual fluctuations in economic growth rate persisted.
in 1991/92, the meager growth of 0.1 percent in agricultural sector are believed to provide impetus to the growth rate of non â€“agricultural sector in the years to come.
on the agricultural front, the development of marketoriented production pattern is necessary for the growth in integrated and coordinated manner to agricultural inputs, services, incentives and irrigation facilities.
at present, owing to the execessive liquidity in the economy, while the rate of consumption in increasing, the rate of savings in on the decline.
the increase in government expenditure and the lack of sufficient development in laternative inves tment sectors capable of attracting private savings have led to increase in consumption and the fall in gross domestic product.
therefore, it is incumbent upon his majestyâ€™s government to adopt suitable policy measures to bring about an increase in savings, to discourage unproductive investment and expenditure, to provide alternative sources for the mbilisation of savings and to promote private sector investment in productive areas.
in view of the government financial situation of the last two years, the reliance on external loans has further accentuated instead of declining because of the need for adjusting the financial deficit caused by increasing government expenditure.
therefore, it is necessary to give special emphasis on the mobilisation of internal resources.
for this purpose, necessary steps must be taken to check the revenue pilferage and explore new sources of government revenue, to broaden the tax bases and simplify the administrative procedures.
it is also essential to curtail unproductive expenditures.
on the monetary front, there has been an excessive increase in money supply since the last year.
due to this excess liquidity in the economy, while there has been a great pressure on price situation, the ration between gross domestic product and current account deficit has remained very high 9.7 percent.
under the present circumstances, the moneysupply should be maintained within desirable limits without causing any undur scarcity of capital to intensify the pace of economic development.
the increase in net foreign assets in also exerting expansionary influence on money supply.
in this context, the foreign exchange should be utilized positively and productively in order to increase productivity and employment opportunities in the economy.
timely improvements on the interest rates are also required for reducing the excessive liquidity and inflation, and for promoting saving habits.
similarly, the policies of loan disbursement by commercial banks in productive, priorityaccorded sectors need to be intensified so as to gradually alleviate poverty through the creation of new employment opportunities for the economic upliftment of the low income rural population.
in the price situation, the problems of high price rise has not only reduced the competit ive capacity of the economy but also caused greas sufferings to the people.
this has created tremendous hardships particularly in the livelihood if the people living below the poverty line.
thus, it is necessary to provide relief to the people by cutting down the rate of increase in prices.
to attain this purpose, it will be essential especially to curtail the unproductive government expenditure, to increase the work efficiency of public undertakings, to monitor the price situation on a regular basis, to emphasize on the attainment of equilibrium in foreign trade and to improve the supply and distribution systems of essential commodities.
in this regard, various steps were taken to achieve a regular and convenient supply of the essential commodities for the common people such as foodgrains, salt, sugar and cement.
during the past two years also, the foreign trade deficit has increased and is the previous years.
this has led to as increase in the current account deficit, too.
the primary items like raw materials and a few manufactured goods still hold prominence in the countryâ€™s export trade.
similarly, the trade deficit with india has increased on account of the increased import of manufactured items from india in comparison to the export of traditional agro based and unprocessed products to that country.
therefore, in order to expand the export trade, due attention must be paid to the identification of new exportable products and the amelioration of quality standards of the export items.
despite the massive investment outlay for agricultural development in each periodic plan in the past, the agriculture sector could not achieve the desired progress.
agriculture is even today primarily dependent on weather condition.
therefore, in order to achieve some concrete growth in agricultural production and productivity, it is essential to make optimum utilization of the irrigation facilities through their suithable renovation, maintenance and operation, and to establish convenient and reliable systems for the distribution of improved seeds and chemical fertilizers, the dissemination of appropriate technology and th e disbursement of agricultural loans.
as the drains and small irrigation projects have a great significance in agriculture and also actively involve the farmers themselves, it is highly essential to undertake such irrigation projects on a priority basis.
a new industrial policy has been formulated to intensify the pace of industrial development.
the new policy have brought and end to the doubts, uncertainties and distortions prevailing is the industrial sector.
following the introduction of the new policy in 1992, approval has been granted by mid june to a remarkable number of industries seeking registration.
at the same time, while three industrial undertakings have already been privatized, the process of privatization will be further continued.
as the liberal and open policies professed by the new industrial policy for improvements on the economy as a whole will create a competitive industrial climate, maximum benefits must be derived from the changed climate by enhancing the industrial capabilities of the entrepreneurs involved in this sector.
the government owned corporations must strengthen their management to enhance their work efficiency.
the sick government undertakings will has to be gradually handed over to the private sector.
additional efforts are required to develop the necessary infrastructure for tourism, which has evolved as a main source of foreign currency earnings, and the involvement of private sector in these efforts should be encouraged.
the heavy reliance on forests for the total energy consumption of the country has led to a massive destruction of forests.
this has had detrimental effects on environmental balance as well as agricultural production.
in the absence of convenient and likelihood of reducing the reliance on traditional sources of energy like forests in the immediate future.
therefore, there is a great need to achieve a consistent balance between the demand and the supply of timber and firewood by according priority to forestry development and by soliciting active participation of the people themselves in afforest ration activity.
in spite of the immense hydropower potential of the country, it has not been possible to significantly exploit this due to the lack of resources.
the hydroelectricity and irrigation facilities need to be expanded through necessary arrangements of means and resources for the maximum utilization of hydro power.
viewed on the basis of cost factor, it seems appropriate to give more emphasis in the construction of small and medium scale hydro electric projects than on iarge scale projects.
greater involvement of orivate sector in required in the generaion and distribution of hydro electricity, too.
one the transport front, although some roads were constructed in the past years, there are still no link roads to some district headquarters.
further, as not much attention was paid to the proper alignment of the rode during construction, the roads have not able to intensify the economic activities of the people living in the road corridors.
therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the task of constructing link road to district headquarters and other feeder roads on the basis of economic feasibility studies and also to the repairs and maintenance of old roads.
â in the field of social services, the country has not been able to derive much benefit except for some progress in the field of education.
the lack of qualitative development in education is the main reason for this situation.
therefore, while keeping education in agreement with moral norm and values, attention must be paid to developing the quality of education and making it joboriented.
higher education faces scarcity of physical facilities for standard pedagogy and is heavily reliant on government grants.
there still persists the problem of maintaining the academic calendar, which has as adverse effect on studentsâ€™ future.
therefore, it is imperative to develop a time bound educational framework and encourage the private sector involvement in higher education.
similarly, there has emerged an urgent need to upgrade the quality of primary and secondary education.
the country has not been able to derive potential benefits from the investment made in the health sector as well.
the physical infrastructure in health sector in being gradually developed and a big investment has also been made in the production of health manpower.
however, while there is a regular complaint from people concerning the unavailability searcity of medcines and manpower in hospitals and health ectres, the burden of the increasing population on exerting a heavy pressure on social services, and this population growth has minimized the impact of development achievements.
no significant education has been achieven in the growth rates of population and infant mortality.
in this context, it has become essential to make maximum possible utilization of existing physical facilities, manpower and service and to extend additional facilities to rural areas.
regarding drinking water, thermajority of the countryâ€™s population is deprived of the ac cess to clean drinking water facility.
the supply of water, in areas where the facility exists, too, has not been able to meet the requirement.
there also persists the problem of purification of drinking water.
on the other hand, it is estimated that about 40 percent of the available drinking water is being list through leakage.
therefore, attention must be paid to the control of leakage and the purification if drinking water along with the extension of drinking water facilities.
the problem of unorganized housing and urbanization has acquired great magnitude.
therefore, there has emerged and urgent need to formulate and implement timely policies and programmes with regard to housing and urbanization.
against the backdrop of the above mentioned problems and challenges, the elected government formed after the general elections of 1991 has initiated in accordance with its manifesto various efforts for the allround development of nepal.
the present government now has to undertake the responsibility of achieving the economic disorder and distortions of the past.
matching the spirit if the challenge, the government has been striving for reforms in economic management by according priority to liberal economic policies and rural areas.
similarly, appropriate steps have been taken by the popularly elected government in the direction of creating a favourable climate for the development of the private sector.
this has already led to some positive results.
several programmes have been initiated to include the rural sector in the main stream of development.
however, the countryâ€™s basic structure if the economy is still very weak.
compared to the overwhelming expectations and the needs of the people, the achievements are still quite insignificant.
the economic growth rate is low and it is essential to bring about qualitative reforms in the economic structure in order to achieve a sustainable and long lasting growth rate.
the depth and extent of poverty, unemployment, the growing disparity between rural and urban sectors and unequitable distribution if development efforts on the days to come.
the eights play is a significant step initiated in that direction.
different fiscal years have been taken as base years in the preparation of the foregoing chapter.
a the final year of the first fiveyear plan 19561961 was 1960/61.
however, before the end of the plan period, the erstwhile democratically elected nepali congress government was dissolved in december, 1960.
subsequently, there were continued efforts from 1961/62 to install panchayat system and as that year was taken as the base year for the second plan 19621965 also, the same year i.e. 1961/62 has been taken as the initial year for comparative studies.
b the fiscal year 1961/62 remained a year without a plan.
no efforts were made that year for the formulation and implementation of plan.
as a result, the fiscal year 1961/62 data were not available ofr certain statistical comparative studies.
the year 1960/61 has been taken as the base for the analysis if those sectors where the 1961/62 data were not available.
c similarly, the data of national income projections in nepal are available only from the year 1964/65.
therefore, the data that require comparison with national income could be made use of only from the year 1964/65 onwards.
besides, because of the unavoidability of using the constant prices if 1964/65 as the base for conversion of certain data to constant prices on the basis of gdp, the fiscal year 1964/65 has been taken as the initial year at certain places and the analysis has been made accordingly.
d in addition, it is appropriate to evaluate government financial position on the basis of current and constant process.
in transforming certain date related to financial position to constant prices, the use of the urban consumer price indices rather than that of implicit deflators of gdp in more practical.
however, as the price indices are available from 1972/73 only, it was possible process only from that year.
e as the date relating to the balance of payments situation are available from the year 1974/75 only, the corresponding analysis has been presented beginning from that year.
nevertheless, in order to assist interested persons interested in of undertaking separate analysis and arriving at relevant conclusions, that data pertaining to the fiscal year 1961/62, 1964/65, 1972/73, 1974/75 and 1989/90 have been presented separately in some tables.
it is certainly not an easy task to accelerate the pace of development in a distorted economic, social and administrative milieu created by the panchayat regime during the last thirty years.
while, on the on hand, the government will definitely have to make some harsh decisions, the development perspectives, on the other hand, will need to be compatible with the prevailing national situation and the economic changes in the international scenario.
as nepali congress in committed to democratic socialism, the principal objective of the economic policy will be the amelioration of the standard of living of the deprived citizens through democratic processes.
socialism, as conceived by the nepali congress, it not orthodox socialism where the state dictates but the one by virtue of which the state in a supportive role will bring about social and economic justice through increase in production, creation of employment and special programmes directed towards the upliftment of the socially and economically deprived poor people who are left out of the mainstream of development.
therefore, the state directed and controlled economic systems pursued for the last thirty years will be gradually phased out and policies will be adopted to carry out development through free marketoriented liberal economic systems.
in this perspective, the goals and objectives defined in the eighth plan will be considered as indicative and as guidelines, the fulfillment of which requires the participation and support of all sections of the nation together with the capabilities of the state.
neither the targeted growth rate was achieved, nor was poverty alleviated.
in view of this fact during the eighth plan period, a conducive environment will be created for development by complementing capital investment with reforms in the ageold traditional social norms and values and inefficient administrative system fostered by the panchayat regime.
as efforts aimed at raising the economic growth rate do not necessarily benefit the poor to a significant extent, special programmes will be undertaken for poverty alleviation at village level and household level.
since continuity in development can not be achieved without a sustained rate of growth, this plan will adopt a selfsustainable development process from the village level onwards.
for this purpose, it is necessary to develop and mobilize human resources from the village level, to develop and extend the infrastructure for rural development and to attain minimum standard of living for the common rural populace.
for this purpose, the budgetary allocation of funds for rural development will be increased to seventy percent of the total development budget outlay.
this new philosophy of planning will be reflected in the procedural structure and methodology of the plan.
development is not merely a mechanical function of capital and technology but it is also a social and political process of mobilizing and organizing people commensurate with the desired goals.
it is essential to canalize the aspirations and enthusiasm of the people generated by the political change in the country to the mainstream of development, and to identify, formulate, implement and distribute the benefits thereof on the basis of peopleâ€™s participat ion.
compatible with the nature of projects and development programmes, conducive environment will be created to involve peasants, laborers and entrepreneurs, engaging the concerned people themselves and the central and effective source of all actions and decisions.
the proposed planning methodology will create a basis for sustained development by promoting development initiatives at the community level by enhancing mass awareness for self development, fostering civic responsibility and selfreliance.
in order to fully translate such development process into practice, the government will adopt the policy of decentralization.
although the panchayat regime had also made provisions for decentralization, it was not implemented effectively.
authority was not decentralized to local level bodies.
since these bodies were directed by both the concerned ministries and local administration, a state of confusion prevailed in their work performance.
the present democratic government will do away with such tradition and effectively implement policies ofdecentralization in all sectors.
in accordance with the policies of democratic socialism, the formulation of plans will eliminate the top down approach to be replaced by the bottom up approach.
for the purpose of avoiding delays in the implementation of development projects, the methods of the disbursement of funds will be simplified and the allocated funds made available in good time.
similarly, local bodies will be empowered to approve tenders for the supply of construction materials and the construction services for local development projects.
concomitantly with the decentralization of authority, the local bodies will be motivated to bear responsibilities.
while village level bodies will be accountable to the district level bodies, they in turn, will be accountable to the centre.
it will be made mandatory that the bodies at all levels keep their accounts transparent.
as the success of the centralization programme depends to a large extent on the abilities and attitudes of the local level employees, arrangeme3nts will be made for upgrading their work performance through training and career development opportunities.
in spite of the slogans of balanced development having been raised even during the panchayat regime, development efforts were comparatively concentrated in developed and urban areas, which gave rise to great social and economic disparities among the regions.
the wide disparity in economic and social facilities between the rural and urban areas has led to unprecedented increase in migration to urban areas.
this has, on the one hand, exerted heavy pressure on drinking water supply system, education health care and transports and also led to greater pollution in urban area, while on the other, the economic and social conditions in the rural areas have further worsened.
with a view to rectify these anomalies, in this context, complementary enterprises and economic activities compatible with the regional means and resources will be implemented.
the balanced development of all sectors in equally important in view if the governmentâ€™s commitment to rural development an d upliftment of the standard of living of the poor people.
regional development will be linked to the village level development and a suitable atmosphere for all citizens to share the returns of the nationâ€™s investment will be created.
to promote regional balance, special grants will be made available during the eighth plan for specific projects on addition to the lump sum government grants to the regions.
the local bodies upon mutual consultations and agreement may use the funds thus provided for specified projects on the basis of regional necessities.
the optimum utilization of regionally available means and resources will also enhance the national.
â production.
as agriculture is the backbone of the national economy and the livelihood of 90 percent of population is associated with this sector, the eighth plan lays special emphasis on the development and modernization of the agricultural sector.
the agricultural development also deserves priority as this alone can increase the income of the common people and thereby expand internal maker for industrial sector.
low cost farming activities with higher rate of return such as intensive farming, horticulture, multiple crop farming, animal husbandry, bee keeping, sericulture, herbs and medicinal plant farming etc. will be promoted for the development of agricultural sector.
at the same time, the genetic diversity of agricultural crops will be utilized for the development of exportoriented products.
the diversification in agriculture will also assist in maintaining the ecological balance.
a free, marketoriented liberal policy will be adopted in order to maintain an efficient flow and optimum utilization of resources in diverse agricultural activities.
as mentioned above, the government does not believe in excessive government control in economic activities.
the private sector, in a controlled economy, can not invest independently and make decisions concerning primary activities such as production and sale, which tends to direct the flow if investment not towards sustainable area but towards the areas that deliver shortterm gains this leads to distortions in economy and the economy lose dynamism causing debility in economic structure.
controlled economic policed pursued by the panchayat regime in the past have given rise to distortions in the industrial structure as they promoted industrial and commercial activities which did not enhance any significant price value at the processing stage but were only profitable in the highly protected indian market.
the nontransparent economic policies and regulations have given rise to rent seeking behaviour causing a considerable weakening of the financial administration.
under such circumstances, while genuine entrepreneurs become discouraged, industrialists and traders, adept at exploiting nontransparent policies to their benefits, will have the upper hand.
as such industrialists are more concerned with investing for short term personal gains rather than for long germ national economy.
in view if these facts, the government will abandon the past policies of excessive control and intervention, and adopt open and liberal policies.
aware of the failure of the government sector all over the world in the production and delivery of goods through resource allocation, the government will assume the role of a catalyst and promote of private sector rather than controlling or interfering with their economic activities.
thus, limiting the scope of the government to some specific areas, the development and extension of all other areas will be left open to private sector.
the principal role of the government will be to develop physical infrastructure necessary for economic development, such as roads and communications, to bring the people so far left out into the mainstream of development, by providing basic social services such as health care, education and drinking water, essential to the longterm national development, the participation of the private sector in these areas, too, will be welcomed, the government will initiate a process of disengagement and disinvestment from a number of areas that may be managed more efficiently by the private sector without jeopardizing social interests.
in accordance with this policy, government owned enterprises and corporations will be gradually privatized.
sp ecial attention will be paid to protect private sector participation on various economic activities.
in respect of several development activities, the private sector and nongovernmental organizations can evidently be more effective in terms of cost, flexibility, motivation and initiative.
the non governmental organizations which are more motivated by social service then profit and also more experienced in working in close association with rural people, are better suited to the tasks of rural development and poverty alleviation.
if these organizations are allowed to play and active role in rural development, there will emerge improvements in income distribution.
considering the fact that the non governmental organizational and community organizations have been effectively engaged in rural development over the past several years, such organizations will be involved to the maximum possible extent in development activities during the eighth plan.
for this purpose the government will remove the policy obstacles and hindrances being faced by these organizations and adopt promotional policies.
the following will be undertaken to this end.
simplification and clarification of administrative processes in order to private initiative from being suppressed.
removal of unnecessary delays to accelerate the government of government policies, and c.
further liberalization, simplification and clarification of government policies, and.
d.
for the aforementioned purpose, plans are underway to review the license system and all other existing policies and regulations with a view to increasing the involvement of private sector and nongovernmental organizations in the economic development of the country.
laws and regulations r elating to registration and the structure of nongovernmental organizations will be simplified and in order to make them capable of mobilizing internal resources to a greater extent, necessary improvements will be made in the legal provisions concerning taxation.
contact and communication with non governmental organizations will be enhanced in order to understand their problems and provide necessary support.
the nongovernmental organizations will be given full autonomy to function in specific priority areas.
to promote the initiative of private sector and nongovernmental organizations in development works, the government will invest in transport, communications, energy, education and public health and develop infrastructure in various parts of the country.
while formulating and executing the economic and social infrastructure for rural development through these organizations, particular attention will be paid to the interest of the entire village rather then to that of an individual.
international nongovernmental organizations have been playing a significant role over the pats several years in the development functions in nepal.
these organizations will be encouraged to work in areas where they can operate more effectively on the basis of their expertise, comparative advantages and recognition.
the selection of areas will be made as far as possible in keeping with the policy of balanced regional development.
as nepal is a severely resource constrained country, it would not be an exaggeration to state that the development process can not be further advanced without foreign assistance.
reliance on foreign assistance without any concrete plan and without paying due attention to the optimum utilization of the assistance during the thirty years of the panchayat regime has given rise to many undesirable consequences placing the country unde3r the burden of foreign debts.
therefore, during the eighth plan period, foreign assistance will be sought only for such priority projects which may not be sustained through internal resources and due attention will be paid to ensuring the maximum effectiveness in the utilization of the assistance.
structural adjustment loans form t he world bank and the international monetary fund will also be put to effective use.
in this connection, the regular budget will be streamlined in respect of government expenditure, revenue will be increased through appropriate monetary and fiscal policies the growth rate of money supply will be maintained within desirable limits and efforts will be made to increase exports through product diversification.
these efforts will br ought stability to national economy and encourage private sector to increase inv estment in productive activities.
objectives and priorities of the eighth plan objectives the broad objective of the eighth plan is to given definite direction to the social and economic upliftem ent of the citizens of the country by tackling the challenges of economic stagnation, increasing poverty, structural anomalies, environmental degradation and rapid population growth.
a single five year plan can not find a remedy to all these problems but it is imperative to take concrete steps in that direction.
the plan will make all possible efforts in this regard.
the principal objectives that the plan aspires to achieve are as following a.
sustainable economic growth b.
poverty alleviation, and c.
reduction of regional imbalances a.
sustainable economic growth one of the principal objectives of the plan is to achieve a high and sustainable rate of economic growth without which there is no possibility of achieving economic prosperity and its continuity.
the economy will not be able to fulfill the developmental aspirations of the common people without a sustainable and high economic growth rate.
however, the present population of the country is already placing excessive demands on existing resources.
if the present trend of population growth is allowed to continue, it will not be possible to meet the demands of the people without causing permanent damage to the biophysical resources.
therefore, it is highly essential to reduce the rate of population growth in order to achieve a sustainable economic growth rate.
to achieve the above mentioned objective, this plan has called for the involvement of private sector and increased peopleâ€™s participation at the community level.
this objective and the concept of equity are complementary to each other.
the plan has made additional efforts to increase the productivity of the productivity of the labour force and to make the financial investment more productive.
similarly, programmes with higher comparative advantages will be implemented in agriculture, industry, tourism and other sectors.
comparative advantages can be achieved by the utilization of low cost hydroelectricity and other natural resources in the production process.
this will produce a comparative advantages especially in energy oriented industries and irrigated cultivable land.
for this purpose, the advanced technology and institutional reforms will be made indispensable tools of support to the private sector and organizations down to the village level and production will be increased on the basis of equity and capability.
poverty alleviation despite the development efforts of the past, the population living below the poverty line has been steadily increasing and the majority of such poverty ridden people live in the rural areas.
the biggest challenge for the present government is to alleviate poverty from the rural sector.
it is the root cause of many of the existing problems of nepal such as population growth, environmental degradation and social anomalies.
therefore, another principal objective of this plan is to alleviate poverty.
although poverty is the result of diverse factors, the basic causes of poverty in nepal are the dependence of the increasing population on limited economic resources and low rate of economic growth.
the visible impediments to economic growth such as natural constraints, preliminary stage of development efforts, low productivity, subsistence agricultural system and slackness in the expansion of nonagricultural sector are the major factors for a weak economic base.
in this perspective, emphasis is given on formulating integrated and inter regional programmes that primarily focus on the creation of productive, emphasis is given on formulating integrated and interregional programmes that primarily focus on the creation of productive assets base and additional employment opportunities to alleviate poverty, extension of social services like health education, vocational training and drinking water, and effective management and protection of natural resources.
as part of the planning and implementation processes programmes will be implemented with the objective of benefiting the population living below the poverty line.
reduction of regional imbalances in nepal, poverty has acquired spatial variations.
despite policypronouncements and efforts in the previous plans, disparities between rural and urban areas and among development regions have increased.
over the recent years, there has been an increased trend of migration from rural to urban areas.
hills to terai migration continue.
if the disparity in urban and rural income is not reduced, this trend my gain greater momentum.
similarly, in comparison with other development regions, far western region and mid western region lag far behind in respect of infrastructural and social service facilities and other development works.
the living standard of the people of these regions have adversely affected by the growing disparity of income distribution caused by these factors.
this has further complicated the creation of equal opportunities for sharing development benefits.
in this context, maintenance of regional balance forms another objective of he eighth plan.
while allocating resources in order to achieve regional balance, due attention has been paid to the necessity of creating physical infrastructure in these less developed regions.
with this objective, while special emphasis has been given on the extension of rural roads, due importance has been attached to the provision of facilities like primary heath care, education and drinking water in rural sector.
the regional complementary interrelationships between the hills and the terai arising out of the existing agroecological conditional can be beneficially utilized for agricultural and industrial specialization.
therefore, the current and future development perspectives will be accorded special emphasis in order to benefit from the ecological interrelationships between the hills and terai.
focusing on the development of less development regions, special emphasis will be laid on the reduction of regional imbalances.
in order to achieve the principal objectives mentioned above, it has become essential to improve economic standard of rural people the achieve selfsustaining rural development through the increased provision of social, economic and market services, and increased access to drinking water and alternative forms of energy.
priorities in view of the limited financial, human and institutional resources of the country, it will not be possible to provide adequate resources to all activities within a single plan period.
this plan will in the course of resource allocation, accord priority to such programmes whose completion provides necessary support to another or those which have a high economic benefit.
the programmes receiving priority in this plan are a agricultural intensification and diversification it is being increasingly realized that the contribution of agriculture to the overall economic development of the nation is not only determined by the growth rate of agriculture but also by its pattern.
development strategies which broaden the base of agricultural development also promote accelerated growth in other areas.
in a development system that encompasses the majority of the population, a greater numger of producers including the marginal ones can have access to the increased rural income.
the demands of such producers are usually related to the goods and services which uses maximum local resources and labour.
for the attainment of equitable economic development, it is necessary to accelerate demands for labour and to expedite food supply.
the agricultural sector alone contributes about three fifths of the gross national product and provides employment to nearly eight tenths of the entire population.
agriculture is that sector which will be able to involve, although only for a short or medium period, the rapidly increasing labour force in productive activities.
as there are severe limitations on expanding the cultivable land, this plan has accorded priority to agricultural intensification and diversification.
with adequate provisions of necessary agricultural support services, intensive farming will be introduced in areas with access to irrigation facilities.
in such areas, the emphasis will mainly be laid on cereal production.
depending upon the suitability of climatic conditions and access to services, agricultural diversification in cash crops, horticultures, vegetable farming and livestock will be emphasized.
in order to meet the urban demand for milk, eggs, fish, meat, fruits and vegetables, priority will be given to intensive productions programmes in areas adjacent to the cities and along road corridors to urban areas.
sericulture, bee keeping medicinal herb farming and similar significant but lowcost small scale activities will be encouraged to increase the income of the farmers in the hills and the mountains.
â b energy development energy plays an important role in the economy, in respect of both domestic and exports sectors of the economy.
although the country is well endowed with abundant biomass and hydropower resources, the pace of industrialization is felt to have slowed down in the recent year mainly because of the lack of energy and power.
while it implies that rapid industrial growth is not possible without tackling the energy constraints, the growth of agricultural production may be impeded by the lack of energy for lifeirrigation and processing of agricultural products.
if an elementary machinery lick water million, diesel engine and biogas plants could be developed in the rural areas, it will contribute immensely to the development of food processing industries and cottage industries.
nepalâ€™s vast potential to generate comparatively cheap hydropower provides comparative advantages in many energy through modern technology and its integration with the development of other sectors of the economy can enhance sectoral productivity as well as comparative advantages.
this will lead to a considerable increase in agricultural productivity as well as a decrease in foreign currency expenditure for the import of diesel.
all these considerations clearly indicate that energy development should be accorded high priority in nepalâ€™s development planning.
development of rural infrastructure in order to support industrial growth, the market for industrial production will be expanded in rural areas by providing roads and other forms of transportation linking rural communities and market centres.
market facilities will be intensively improved in order to aid the convenient supply of necessary agricultural inputs as well as the sale and purchase of surplus agricultural produce.
necessary infrastructure will be built for the development of rural irrigation, drinking water, electricity,.
communications, rural industries and tourism etc. providing the basic facilities of life such as suspension bridges, schools and health care, the environment in the villages will be made comfortably in the rural areas.
the rural development infrastructure will provide employment opportunities to the growing labour force of the rural sector.
therefore, this plan has accorded high priority to the creation of the entire infrastructure if rural development.
employment generation and human resource development the creation of productive employment opportunities in the country has been given top priority by this plan.
in order to create employment opportunities at an accelerated rate, all possible avenues have been explored in the sectoral programmes.
since nearly 90 percent of the population live in rural areas, the plan has laid special emphasis on generating greater employment opportunities in rural areas.
thus, the plan has emphasized on bigger investment in rural areas for the development of nonagricultural activities such as development and renovation of infrastructure, expansion of agriculture through the use of electricity and cottage industries based on local energy resources.
this plan has made arrangements of adequate resources of further productive involvement of the existing human resources in the efforts of national development.
since the existing labour force is largely illiterate and unskilled, basic education and technical and vocational training opportunities will be expanded with particular emphasis on rural areas.
control of population growth the available resources in the country cannot forever sustain the current rate of population growth.
the rapid increase in population leaves only an insignificant portion of resources for development works.
there can be no prospect for a substantial increase in the average income of the people if the population is allowed to grow at the present rate.
therefore, the reduction in the rate of population growth is one of the priority areas of this plan.
the family planning devices are still not readily available in various parts of the country.
it has been proved that family planning devices are being used only in areas with the spread of literacy among women and with easy access to primary health facilities, and in families with high standard of living.
therefore, this plan has placed special emphasis on the awareness creation programmes to increase in the demand for family planning devices.
industrial development and tourism promotion economic prosperity depends upon a rapid sustainable economic development.
for the attainment of accelerated economic development in the country, industrialization is equally as important as that of agriculture and other primary sectors.
the industrialization, in the process of value added contributes, to the creation of new employment opportunities and economic integration.
the eight h plan policies have been so formulated that they will promote the sustainable growth of large as well as cottage industries.
during this plan period, an atmosphere favourable to the open and competitive growth of industries will be created and expanded.
the private sector as well as foreign investors will be particularly encouraged through appropriate policy measures to invest in the industrial sector.
similarly, tourism sector will be promoted in order to generate increased foreign exchange, employment and income.
because of the gifts of nature, it is in tourism that nepal can gain comparative advantages.
however, owing to the constraints in the supply of necessary commodities and insufficient and incompatible initiatives, tourism has so far been a seasonal phenomenon and has not been able to make the desired headway.
in order to make use of all feasible development prospects, the eights plan has accorded special priority to the overall development of this sector.
the government will invest in the creation of infrastructure of industry and tourism, and provide support to the private sector.
policies will be continued to be effectively implemented so as to induce the domestic and foreign investors to increases their investment with confidence and to generate higher returns as cooperated to the rate of investment.
in this connection, some pioneering steps have already been taken with regard to policy matter.
export promotion and diversification the rapid widening of trade and current account deficits in recent years has become a matter of serious concern to the country.
the complications in the export of traditional and some new kinds of manufactured goods and the quantitative decline in the agricultural products have contributed to the narrowing of the agricultural products have contributed to the narrowing of the export base of nepal.
the market available to nepalese exporters in limited.
these factors have impeded the attainment of stability in the growth of export.
although the carpet and garment industries have re3corded a significant growth in export earnings over the recent years, in views of quality control, proper organizational structure, large scale production and innovations in the production patterns, it is necessary to improve the quality standards of the products for markets to which they have been usually exported.
new products have not been successfully identified as yes for export promotion programmes.
the growth of the export sector has been restricted due to the lack of clearcut export policies and low priority accorded to it in the past.
the eighth plan has given priority to the production and promotion of both traditional agricultural commodities and new exportable products.
this plan has adopted the strategy of promoting market oriented production which will contribute to the development of production as well as market facilities.
macroeconomic stabilization the expansionary policy adopted in the past has given rise to excessive liquidity, increasing money supply, increasing trade imbalance and high price rise.
this has weakened the stability of the economy.
under the given circumstances, the policies of macro economic stabilization and structural adjustments can play a significant role in the attainment of the objective of stability in economic growth rate.
in this connection, the plan has given special emphasis to a more rational allocation of resources, better management of public expenditures, enhanced mobilization of internal resources, greater performance in public sector investment and the strengthening of public enterprises, open and simple foreign exchange policies and regulations, and prudent fiscal and monetary policies.
due emphasis has been given on the reinforcement of the present financial system in order to further mobilize savings in the private sector.
encouragement has been provided to the establishment of new financial institutions and the development of capital markets.
exploration of new methods of saving has been encouraged by removing the control of the central bank on the fixation of interest rates.
reforms in development administration the increasing proportion of administrative cost in development investment and slow decision making processes have led delays in the projects implementation.
as the employees in public sectors consume, even at the existing low salary scales., a major share of the government revenue only a meager portion of it is available of capital investment.
the lack of a suitable working atmosphere, the gradual decline in the morale of civil servants and the lack of the sense of responsibility can be cited as examples of additional constraints.
there is a treat need for reforms in the exi sting system of recruitment, positing, training and promotion.
during this plan period, reforms through appropriate measures will be introduced in order to make the development administration capable enough to meet the challenges of national development.
monitoring and evaluation while the planned projects are not usually implemented on time, the project subsequent to their implementation, too, have failed to produce the desired result.
this has led to a disparity between planning and implementation, and between implementation and achievements, which have been a matter of great concern to the government as well as donor countries.
in such grave circumstances, the government has fully understood the need for institutionalization of the monitoring and evaluation systems with respect to development projects and programmes.
during the plan period, an effective monitoring and evaluation system will be devised and institutionalized, which will not only ensure the timely implementation of projects but also encourage management accountability and performance oriented evaluation system in the public sector.
economic growth rate, total investment and sectoral allocations â macro economic bases of eighth plan consistency among objectives, policies, programmes and investment must be established in the course of formulating a plan.
moreover, due attention must be paid in the plan to the appropriate allocation of resources and the methods of their effective utilization.
with a view to eliminating the disparity between investment plan and targets and making the plan more realistic, the plan should frame an investment programme using appropriate techniques, based on the proper assessment of all viable alternatives, similarly, and estimate needs to be made with regard to the availability of resources as well as the growth rate likely to be achieved during the plan period on the basis of alternative sectoral plans.
in the past, the plans did not pay required attention to these aspects, nor was an appropriate planning methodology used, the economic growth rate was determined in the initial stage of planning based on external variables.
therefore, the extent if requisite investment of the plan was fixed on the basis of crude incremental capital output ratios.
this methodology did not pay due at tention of the need to establish coordination between various internal and external variables.
this was a closed economy concept, which disregards the analysis of interrelationships among diverse economic areas.
there were particularly there vita flaws in this methodology.
firstly, the fact that the availability of resources is determined by the implementation of the plan and the economic achievement to be made during the plan period was neglected.
this led to arbitrary estimates of resources likely to be available in the plan period.
secondly, as this methodology fixes the investment requirement based in incremental capital output ration with total disregard to economy in sectoral allocations and better resultoriented standards, it can not be utilized in the evaluation of alternative resource allocations and in the analysis of the effects of alternative investment plan on production, employment and other variables as a whole.
thirdly, it does not help in the analysis of programmes and alternative policies, and in the assessment and formulation of these programmes and policies in the perspective of attaining total objective the techniques of macromodel have been employed in the formulation of the eighth plan.
this helps to assess the probable effects of alternative investment programme on the economy.
according to this methodology.
the total and sectoral value added has been determined within the framework of the model and the fact that the total and sectoral investment has a decisive impact on the overall economic growth rate has been taken into consideration.
the total sectoral demands for labour are primarily determined by the growth rates of production in various sectors.
budgetary deficit, monetary and structural variables of the economy cause monetary expansion and price determination.
budgetary deficit affects imports as well as balance of payments, which is a peculiar characteristic of a small economy like our.
total investment is fixed by the extent of external and internal savings, and thus in turn, by the supply of investment resources too.
the sectoral incremental capital output rations have been estimated on the basis of internal processes of the model.
this will assist in the assessment of the probable effects of alternative investment programmes on medium term economic growth and short term economic stability.
this will also facilitate the evaluation of the impact on the economy of the growth of economic efficiency created by the sectoral policy measures such as appropriate regional allocation of resources, selection of suitable projects and monitoring system, prudent economic management, economic openness and privatization.
the modeling technique will make it possible to assess the prevailing or the likely negative influence on the economy of low productivity, supply and structural constraints, lack of prudence in the allocation and utilization of resources and the unnecessary government interfence in various economic sectors.
likewise this will also help in evaluating the probable effects on the economy from the probable growth in saving brought about by the favourable changes in the internal and external economic environment, reduction in unproductive government expenditure and the accelerated growth of investment in industries.
thus, there is a great need for additional reforms in spite of the various reforms proposed in this plan period.
the modeling technique adopted in the eighth plan cannot contribute much to the task of evaluating interregional relationships and the flow of regional means and resources, as it is devoted to the analysis of cumulative constraints as a whole.
therefore, the national planning commission has accorded priority to the collection of additional data and the extension of planning methodology.
this will facilitate the further analysis of various aspects of interregional relations in the future.
police bases in the past, there existed a vast gulf between the target and the achievements of the plans.
in the absence of appropriate policy, strategy and programmes, the economy became increasingly cost oriented and the government expenditure was getting more inclined toward unproductive sectors, difficult to be sustained by the economy.
the increasing government participation and interference and the lack of a favorable atmosphere for the involvement of private sector also contributed to the slow growth of the industrial sector.
the major share of the private sector was attracted towards the unproductive areas such as real estate.
the increased loss in the government owned corporations, the excessive expansion of the government expenditures and the excessive dependence in deficit budgeting for compensatory measures created greater impediments to the task of promoting medium and long term development programmes, gradually imparting stability to the economy at the same time.
these trends continue to exist even today.
therefore, the greatest challenge now is to devise ways and means of discouraging these trends and steering the economy in the direction of more productive and sustainable economic development through appropriate policy reforms.
the nation faces the complex challenges of accelerating the economic development, alleviating poverty and reducing regional imbalances and raising the living standard if the people in a short period through and extensive increase in employment opportunities against the backdrop of the scarcity of means and resources.
thus, at present there is a persistent need for extensive policy reforms and changes.
therefore, the eights plan has adopted in its formulation some policy bases such as the allocation of investment in high productive areas in keeping with the priorities accorded by the plan the attainment of performance efficiency in industry, communications, trade, hotel keeping, finance and real estate, through appropriate management of government expenditure control of government expenses introduction of suitable selection process and workperformance monitoring systems in the formulation and implementation of the plan promotion of private sector involvement in the economy through economic liberalization and privatization and maintenance of proper balance and coordination among economic growth rate, availability of resources and other macro variables.
economic growth rate on the basis of an extensive evaluation of the alternative investment programmes and policies to be adopted by the plan, it is estimated that a 5.1 percent average annual growth rate will be achieved during the eighth plan period table 1.
this growth rate is higher than that of the last three decades.
this growth rate is higher than that if the last three decades.
the average long term growth rate in domestic product was merely 3 percent and this was responsible for the lack of growth in per capital inco me.
in view if the disappointing state if the per capital income and the increase in poverty, it has become imperative to achieve higher economic growth rate for the amelioration of the standard of living of the common people.
although this growth rate would seem ambitious in the light of past experiences, it will be possible to achieve the above mentioned growth rate in the new political and economic environment.
the appropriate utilization of the existing infrastructure of the economy will also contribute to the increase in the growth rate of gross domestic product.
similarly, the prospective growth in the rate of private savings and the curtailment of unproductive government spending will provide additional help in increasing the economic growth rate.
furthermore, the achievement of the above growth rate alone will ensure additional advantages to the economy and provide a sound basis for further accelerated economic growth rate and an increase in additional employment opportunities in future.
â the estimated growth rate of the eighth plan con not be considered unduly high in comparison with the high growth rates achieved by developing nations through economic liberalization.
the appropriate allocations and utilization of resources, economic liberalization and other policy reforms will contribute further towards the attainment of the economic growth rate of 5.1 percent in the eighth plan period.
on the assumption that the rate of population growth will be 2.1 percent during the plan period, the above economic growth rate will result in a three fold increase over previous percapita growth rates or a three percent annual growth in per capital income.
during the plan period, the above economic growth rate will be achieved by increasing productivity, by exercising greater discipline in government expenditure, and by implementing policy reforms which will attract the private sector investment in the fields of industry, trade, finance and sp on.
an analysis conducted on the basis of the current extent of available foreign aid indicates that extensive improvements in work performance and considerable increase in domestic savings must be achieved in order to further increase the economic growth rate.
although foreign debts can substitute for the difference between investment and savings, they may have adverse effect on the payment of principal and interest and inflation.
the above growth rate also appears to be an appropriate proposition on the basis of the capabilities of the economy and the uncertainties as to the mode of implementation of economic liberalization by the countries with which there are regional trade relations.
in order the achieve the targeted value added growth rate in the eighth plan period, a 5.1 percent growth rate in the gross domestic product will be achieved by means of a 3.7 percent increase in agricultural value added and a 6.1 percent increase in nonagricultural value added.
the higher nonagricultural value added in comparison to the agricultural one will lead to structural changes in the economic by the final year of the plan.
as shown in table 1, the share of non agricultural sector will rise from 44.5 percent in 1991/92 to 47.3 percent in 1996/97.
although the gr owth rate which appears in the structure of domestic product will be only marginal and the agricultural sector continues to hold the major share up to the end of the plan period, these changes will certainly contribute to the creation of new employment opportunities and an accelerated growth in the nonagricultural production.
the estimated economic growth rates indicate a progressive upward trend in the rate of growth in the economy.
total investment requirement for the plan period and sectoral allocation of resources as mentioned above, the size of total investment and its sectoral allocation patterns, growth in productivity, the control in government expenditure and the policies encouraging the diversion of private sector savings to productive sectors will contribute to the attainment of a 5.1 percent economic growth rate.
the estimated sectoral allocation of investment is based on a detailed analysis of existing and potential capit al productivity in eight major sectors of economy.
compared to the seventh plan, a slight increase is proposed in the sectoral shares of investment in agriculture, irrigation, forestry, trade, hotel and restaurants and social services.
there are three fundamental grounds for the proposed investment pattern.
firstly, the selection of appropriate projects and new policies of evaluation will give rise to increased efficiency in various sectors.
the national planning commission will have to play a significant role in the upgrading of such efficiency.
the application of new policies and methods of the selection of projects and evaluation, in particular, will result in economy in investment, and the investment units in various sectors will help the growth of production in those areas.
secondly, the policy of economic liberalization will direct the flow of resources to productive sectors such as agriculture, industry, trade and tourism.
thus, the share of industrial sector in total investment will rise to an average of 8.8 percent in the eighth plan from the 7.7 percent average of the seventh plan.
similarly, the share of agriculture, irrigation and forestry will increase to 25.8 percent for 24.5 and this increase will have been made possible mainly by the development programmes related to rural development.
thirdly, as the eighth plan lays special emphasis on rural development, there will be a considerable increase in peopleâ€™s participation and the contribution of labour.
therefore, in spite of the lack of larger financial investment, there will be a higher generation of capital in these sectors.
the total gross investment outlay for the eighth plan period is estimated to be rs. 170,332 million table2.
this estimate is based on the assumption that there will be an improvement over the past incremental capital output ration of 4.51 to 4.31.
the incremental capital output ration is estimated to be as decline because of the projected better results of expenditures in governmental sectors to be made possible by the policy of economic liberalization in the private sector, and appropriate selection of projects, budget, expenditure, management and monitoring systems.
as shown in table 2, the share of agriculture, irrigation and forestry in total investment will reach 25.8 percent.
similarly, compared to the seventh plan, the investment share of industry, trade, hotel and restaurants and social services will also increase in the eight plan.
the proposed size of total investment and its sectoral allocation patterns will primarily contribute to the increase in the aggregate and secotral production growth rates.
similarly, the growth of efficiency in some sectors, too, will cause a marginal decline in the incremental capital output ratio.
out of the total gross fixed investment of rs. 170,332 million, rs. 109,193 million 64.1 percent will be invested by the private sector while the remaining rs. 61,139 million 55.9 percent will be invested by the government sector table3.
in the seventh plan the amount of total investment stood at rs. 103, 014 million at 1991/92 prices.
thus, compared to the seventh plan, investment during the eighth plan period will have to be increased by 10.6 percent per annum.
although this rate appears to be fairly high compared to that of other least developed nations, considering that the eighth plan has been initiated at a time when there in a limited capital base, it will be possible to increase the investment at the above mentioned rate.
the new environment created by liberal economic policies will also promote the increase of the investment growth rate.
in the seventh plan, the share of government sector stood at 41 percent of gross fixed investment, which will come down to 35.9 percent in the eighth plan.
it is expected that the adoption of liberal economic policies will increase the growth rate of investment from the private sector.
thus, the share of the private sector investment is estimated to reach 64.1 of gross fixed investment during the eighth plan period.
although a total investment of rs. 61,139 million is proposed for the public sector, it will be necessary to spend development out lay equivalent to rs. 113.479 million during the eighth plan period.
as shown in talbe 4, of the total development outlay of 113,479 million, social services and agriculture, irrigation and forestry sectors will receive a higher share of the total development outlay 31.5 and 25.7 percent respectively followed by electricity 20.9 percent and transport and communications 17.7 percent.
a detailed sectoral breakdown of the total development outlay is presented in table 5.
the differences in the shares of sectoral gross fixed investment in total development outlay are caused by the differences in the nature of the programmes proposed in various sectors.
sources of investment out of the total fixed capital investment of rs. 170,323 million, 56.3 percent rs. 95,977 million will be borne thought national savings.
of the remaining 43.7 percent rs.74,355 million 26.6 percent rs. 19,761 million will be financed through foreign grants and 73.4 percent rs. 54,594 million through external loans.
from the table, it clearly appears that ins spite of high priority accorded to private sector investment, the private sectorâ€™s savings in likely to exceed its investment amount.
however, despite the reduced investment, there may be considerable negative savings accumulation in the public sector.
the expansion of the public sector and the uncontrolled inclusion of numerous projects during the panchayat regime have led to the continuity of an expenditure burden in the initial years of the eighth plan entailing a continued increase in government expenditure and negative savings.
the almost unsustainable upward trend in negative savings appears to have gained impetus during the last decade of the panchayat regime and the main contributing factor for this is a great increase in the unproductive and consumption expenditure of the public sector.
although the size of negative savings is expected to reduce towards the end of the plan upon gradual improvements over the budgeting and accounting systems used in regular and development budgets, it will take a number of years to make the public sector capable of generating savings.
as shown in table6, the negative savings during the eighth plan will be, more or less, equivalent to 34.5 percent of the gross fixed capital investment of the public sector.
at the economic growth rate of 5.1 percent, the government revenue will increase by 9.7 percent, but the share of negative savings will continue to be high due to its increasing trend in the past.
the deficit between the public sector negative savings and investment will be borne thorough foreign assistance and internal borrowing.
internal loans will primarily be arranged from private sector saving, which will facilitate the control of money supply and price level.
a little different picture emerges when the level of development outlay and sources of financing are analyzed.
as shown in table 7, during the eighth plan, the share of revenue surplus in development outlay will remain 27.5 percent and the share of foreign aid will be maintained at 65.5 percent.
only 7,5 percent will be borne through internal borrowing.
thus the extent of deficit financing will be much lower in this plan than in the previous plans.
â macroeconomic impact of total and sectoral investment the reallocation in sectoral investment and economy in resource utilization, accompanied by liberal economic policies, will not only help achieve higher growth rates but also increase employment opportunities and maintain economic stability during the plan period.
besides, the creation of a favorable environment for private sector will also stimulate growth in domestic savings.
as shown in table 8, gross domestic savings will rise from 9.5 of the gross domestic product in 1991/92 to 12.5 percent of gross domestic product by the end of the plan period in 1996/97.
the deficit finance will be reduced from 1.7 percent of the gross domestic product in 1991/92 to less than one percent of gdp by the end of the eight plan.
similarly, the current account deficit will also be reduced from 9.6 percent of gross domestic product in 1991/92 to 8.0 percent in 1996/97.
the share of government consumption is expected to increase only moderately from 11.5 percent of the gross domestic product in 1991/92 to 12.6 percent of the gross domestic product in 1996/97.
the increase in money supply during the plan period will be lim ited to 12.1 percent per annum, which will help in limiting inflation to about 9 percent.
the policy and structural reforms to be adopted during the plan period do not permit any great reduction in the average rate of inflation.
however, since these reforms will help achieve stability in the economy, they will facilitate the task of reducing the rate of inflation in the years to come.
during the eighth plan period, the rate of inflation will be maintained below 9 percent in average by reducing the increasing liquidity of the economy and by adopting other appropriate monetary and fiscal policy measures.
this increase in manpower demand in expected to take place as a result of the increase in investment in different sectors of the economy and the subsequent rise in value added.
the increased demand in the labour force during the eighth plan period is expected to reach over 1.4 million jobs.
thus, the macroeconomic implications of total and sectoral investment outlay indicate that, provided the proposed policies and programmes are effectively implemented in time, they will be able to contribute in constantly raising the economic growth rate, maintaining economic stability and alleviating poverty through the extension of employment opportunities.
â in the pas t, the nepalese economy remained considerably weak in matters of achieving higher economic growth rate and maintaining stability.
the declining productivity in the government sectors, the reduction in the share of domestic savings in gross domestic product and the flow of a major share of total private sector investment towards unproductive capital sector such as real estate also have created several problems in the economy.
therefore, in order to raise the productivity of the government sector, special emphasis will have to be given on the method of selecting appropriate projects, appropriate pricing policy, reformative institutionalized systems of monitoring and evaluation and the privatization of government undertakings.
it is necessary to promote productive investment policies which encourage the private sector to save and to direct their investment from the unproductive sector like real estate to the sectors capable of achieving higher economic growth rate such as industry.
the emphasis on efficient and economicgrowth oriented sectors and the subsequent desirable structural changes in the eighth plan will provide considerable advantages to the economy during and even after the eighth plan period.
a s the returns from investment take long time to materialize, the policy reforms and the structural changes in the eighth plan are confidently expected to increase the workperformance of the economy particularly in the later years of the plan and thereafter.
estimates of development materials following is the estimated requirement of construction and development materials during the plan period for development programmes to be implemented during the eighth plan.
although the total installed capacity of the industries producing these materials is 229, 000 metric tons per annum, they are found to be operating at only 25 percent of their installed capacity.
bricks an estimated requirement of 8,800 million bricks for the eighth plan is exp ected to be met by the production of the industries in the public as well as private sectors.
timber timer is used in industries, construction work and for fuel wood.
it is estimated that government agencies will be able to supply a total of 15,850 million cubic feet of timber of different types during the plan period.
polythene pipes in view if the policy of expanding drinking water facilities, there will be an increase in the use of polythene pipes in the plan period.
accordingly, 17,000 metric tons of polythene pipes are estimated to be put into use during this plan period.
chemical fertilizers the requirement of chemical fertilizers for the eighth plan is estimated to be 916,000 metric tons the total requirement of chemical fertilizers in the country is being met through import.
mineral oils the items under mineral oils are petrol, diesel, kerosene oil, aviation fuel, light diesel oil, furnace oil, l.p.
gas, and bitumen etc.
a total of 1,993,000 kilo liters of petroleum products in estimated to be required during the eighth plan period.
the entire requirement of these products will have to be met through import.
a project has been initiated in view of the natural gas deposits found at different places in the kathmandu valley.
coke and coal the estimated consumption of coke and coal for the eighth plan is 1,113,000 metric tons, which is expected to be met through import.
writing and printing paper the consumption of writing and printing paper during the eighth plan is estimated to be 121,000 metric tons.
out of this requirement, 21 percent only is expected to be met through the production of bhrikuti paper factory and everest paper mills.
news print during the eighth plan period, the demand for newsprint in estimated to be 18,000 metric tons the entire demand is expected to be met through import.
explosives the estimated demand for explosives during the eighth plan period is 1,400 metric tons.
the requirement is expected to be met even through the production of the factory of the royal nepalese army.
ï»¿irrigation introduction irrigation plays a key role in the development of agricultural sector which has remained the backbone of the country's economy.
although agriculture sector contributes the most to gross national production, the development in irrigation has been less than expected.
the agriculture sector has still to rely largely on rainfall.
frequent drought and excessive rain have hampered the actual growth of agricultural reduction on one and, while on the other, the rapid population growth has led to a situation of food import for meeting the growing demand.
in this context, it has become essential to emphasize on the irrigation development for increased agricultural production from the limited 1and with the use of surface and groundwater resources available in the country.
while planning for irrigation development, it is also necessary to maintain coordination between irrigation and agricultural production programmes towards achieving maximum benefit.
it has also become important to entrust full responsibility of the operation and management of irrigation systems to user farmers after soliciting their organised participation in the identification, feasibility studies, selection and implementation of irrigation systems.
progress during the seventh plan department of irrigation and agriculture development bank have together developed irrigation facilities in 179,337 ha of land during the seventh plan period.
similarly, an additional 48,337 ha has been developed during the two years interim period of fy 1990/1991 and 1991/1992.
it is estimated that a tota1 of 598,804 ha of land will have received irrigation facility by t he end of fy 1991/1 92.fu11 detail are given in table 1.
existing problems.
construction work of big projects planned to provide irrigation facility to large areas not being completed in time and completed projects not operating in full capacity.
no timely availability of water required for irrigation and increasing financial burden on hmg due to disappointing realisation of water cess and consequent need to make large annual budgetary investments in repair and maintenance of the systems.
high per hectare costs of projects constructed at the government leve1.
annually increasing government 'liability in small and medium projects up to 2,000 ha due to the delay in executing the policy of handing over such projects to the user committees.
failure to commence the construction or the need to defer construction of projects included in the seventh plan like babai, sikta and others in want of funding source.
inadequate participation of nongovernmental organisations and the private sectors in the implementation of irrigation projects.
farmer's inability to derive expected benefits from the project s due to project implementing government agency's lack of direct accountability towards the people.
unsustainability of the projects due to the lack of necessary attention towards the institutional aspects during the execution of the programme by the government agency.
considering the above problems, necessary measures will be taken to complete the irrigation projects within the allocated time during the eighth plan period.
priority will be given to the construction of lowcost projects for their sustained operation through maximum mobilisation of available resources with the participation of government and semigovernment organisations and private and nongovernment sector.
adequate measures will be effected in the promotion and extension of appropriate technology including irrigation management improvement.
background of the eighth plan development and expansionu of irrigation facilities is essential for increasing agricultural production required to ensure economic growth and security in food supply.
in spite of huge past investment made in this sector, farming still depends, to a large extent, on rainfa11.
furthermore, even the completed projects have not been possible to be fully utilised.
every year,there is a need to make huge investment on the repair, maintenance and operation of large projects.
but these projects have not enable to provide irrigation facilities to the farmers on time.
besides, in the context of large under construction now being cost ineffective from financial perspective, doubt has been raised about the validity of their implementation.
the very name "irrigation" has appeared to be synonymous with a viscious cycle of construction, nonoperation and again reconstruction.
such a state of counterproductive investments in irrigation sector is sure to make a negative impact on the national economy.
because of the fact that most of the small irrigation systems are operate by farmers, it seems desirable to pay special attention to such projects as can be managed and operated by themselves.
the costs per hectare of some of the government constructed projects are found to range from re. 60,000 to re 100,000 or more.
also observed are the costs per hectare of projects constructed with the participate on of farmers to be ranging from re. 8,000 to rs 25,000.
the latter seem be sustainable as repair, maintenance and operation works in such projects are carried out by the users themselves.
climatological conditions vary across different parts of the country due to the country's physiographic.
it has, therefore, become very essential to maintain coordination between the choice of crops and the provision of irrigation facility.
in the same vein, it is necessary to develop and extend small irrigation systems that conform to the country's physiographic and cause minimum adverse impact on the environment.
objective irigation projects in the eighth plan will be implemented to achieve the following objectives 1.
to increase agricultural production using appropriate irrigation technologies suited to varying geophysical and climatic conditions of the country and that cause minimum negative impact on the environment.
to increase agricultural production and productivity by improving the man agreement of existing irrigation systems to bring about increased reliability in irrigation management.
to provide maximum irrigation facility by implementing financially, technically and environmentally sustainable and cost effective projects with farmers participation.
to achieve the aforementioned objectives, development and extension of irrigation facilities will be undertaken on the basis of following priorities 1.
projects costing less per hectare and projects requiring minimum government involvement in repair and maintenance.
projects guaranteeing high people's participation projects that can be implemented, operated and maintained by users themselves and projects requiring minimum government investment.
projects more likely to benefit small farmers and backward communities.
projects yielding quick returns.
projects constructed in the past which now remain nonoperational and can be rehabilitated at low cost with the organised participation of farmers.
multipurpose projects of national importance.
irrigation projects in underconstruction stage.
policies following policies will be pursued for achieving the irrigation targets set 1.
projects with less cost per hectare will be selected after the survey of potential projects requested by the farmer.
while planning any irrigation project, users will be involved in every step right from project initiation.
same procedure will be followed for repair and maintenance as well.
public communication means will be used while implementing the programme with a view to provide equa1 opportunity to all for participation.
additional investment in projects under construction stage for many years and those with high cost per hectare will be made only after their thorough re evaluation.
farmers' field channels will continue to be improved with the users' participation by arranging necessary technical assistance.
besides, tube wells and wells constructed in the past will be renovated as needed.
necessary arrangements will be made to avail electricity and drinking water from the small irrigation systems, if found feasible to do so.
private sector will be encouraged to actively involve in the development and expansion of irrigation facility.
joint management system will be applied for involving the users in the management of multipurpose, large an medium projects with special emphasis given on irrigation management training institutional development at the farmers' level and access to technical services.
encouragement will be given for the operation of government constructed project s commanding over 2,000 ha in the terai and 500 ha in the hills under the joint management of the responsible government agency and the users' committee.
government constructed projects commanding less than 2,000 ha in the terai and 500 he in the hills will continue to be handed over to the ser committees.
conjunctive use of groundwater will be encouraged to be used in areas not irrigable round the year by surface system only.
construction expenses of small and medium projects will be jointly borne by his majesty's government and the users.
lift irrigation powered by electricity, biogas and wind wi11 be encouraged where feasible power in order to reduce dependence on imported fuel.
the users associations and committees will be mandatorily involved in the co, lection of water fees in order to instill selfreliance in projects to be operated at the government level and under joint management.
water cess will be levied only when services are actually provided to the farmers.
priority will be given to the installation of shallow tubewell s in areas where shallow aquifers exist.
the insta11 at, on of the tubewells will be gradually be transferred from the government to the private sector.
ground water exploration, feasibility study and monitoring in will be carried out on a priority basis.
arrangements wi11 be made to avai1 information relating to groundwater to concerned district development committees, district irrigation offices and other agencies.
feasibility study reports prepared to date will be made available to the district irrigation office and the indices of such reports will be made available to the concerned district development committee and users ' committees.
while executing the small irrigation projects, the concerned agency will have to explain clearly about cash voluntary labour and repair and maintenance expenses to be borne by the users ' committee, and should execute the project after getting written agreement from them on these provisions, construction expenses of the project will be operated by joint signature of the person nominated by the usersâ€™ committee and the technical representative of the executing agency.
it will be mandatory to get the decision of the user's committee if any part of the project needs to be awarded to a contractor.
arrangements will be made to keep the records of expenditure in clear and transparent manner at all levels.
arrangements will be made to clearly determine peopleâ€™s participation while implementing any project.
when implementing any project a fixed sum of money will be borne by his majesty's government and the rest by the users' committee.
specified management expenses will be made available to be implemented in order solicit increased participation of the semigovernmental organisation, the nongovernmental association/ organisation and the private agency.
